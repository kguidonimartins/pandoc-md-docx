abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Running title: Abundancebased multiplesite dissimilarity Summary 1. Abundancebased assemblage dissimilarity can be partitioned into components accounting for (i) balanced variation in abundance, whereby the individuals of some species in one site are substituted by the same number of individuals of different species in another site, and (ii) abundance gradients, whereby some individuals are lost from one site to the other. 2. Such a method was available for pairwise dissimilarity but not for multiplesite dissimilarity. 3. New multiplesite extensions of BrayCurtis and Ruzicka indices based on the formulation of multiplesite analogues of matching components (i.e. the intersection and the relative complements among multiple sites in terms of species abundances) are introduced. 4. These new indices can be partitioned into balancedvariation and abundancegradients components. 5. An example assessing multiplesite dissimilarity of birds and butterflies in a mosaic of habitats is shown to illustrate the usefulness of comparing incidenceand abundancebased multiplesite dissimilarity and its components to characterize biotic heterogeneity across multiple sites. 6. The method may be generally useful when the question of interest is the overall abundancebased dissimilarity across multiple units (in space, time or other), as separating the balancevariation (i.e. substitution) and abundancegradients (i.e. subsets) components of dissimilarity can shed light on the processes behind variation in species abundances.},

abstract = {The degree to which turnover in biological communities is structured by deterministic or stochastic factors and the identities of influential deterministic factors are fundamental, yet unresolved, questions in ecology. Answers to these questions are particularly important for projecting the fate of forests with diverse disturbance histories worldwide. To uncover the processes governing turnover we use species-level molecular phylogenies and functional trait data sets for two long-term tropical forest plots with contrasting disturbance histories: one forest is older-growth, and one was recently disturbed. Having both phylogenetic and functional information further allows us to parse out the deterministic influences of different ecological filters. With the use of null models we find that compositional turnover was random with respect to phylogeny on average, but highly nonrandom with respect to measured functional traits. Furthermore, as predicted by a deterministic assembly process, the older-growth and disturbed forests were characterized by less than and greater than expected functional turnover, respectively. These results suggest that the abiotic environment, which changes due to succession in the disturbed forest, strongly governs the temporal dynamics of disturbed and undisturbed tropical forests. Predicting future changes in the composition of disturbed and undisturbed forests may therefore be tractable when using a functional-trait-based approach.},

Studies of $\beta$-diversity examine many different levels of biological organization, spanning variation in species, functional-trait, and phylogenetic composition both within and across trophic levels. As a scalar that links patterns of diversity across local and regional scales, $\beta$-diversity can inform conservation and provide insights into fundamental processes underlying the assembly, diversity and dynamics of communities.},

abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {The concept of alternative stable states has long been a dominant framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in community assembly. This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly.},

The vast majority of studies conducted to date have comprised static analyses where communities are observed at a single snapshot in time. Long-term datasets present a vantage point to compare established and emerging theoretical predictions on the phylogenetic and functional trajectory of communities through succession. We investigated within, and between, community measures of phylogenetic and functional diversity in a fire-prone heathland along a 21 year time series. Contrary to widely held expectations that increased competition through succession should inhibit the coexistence of species with high niche overlap, plots became more phylogenetically and functionally clustered with time since fire. There were significant directional shifts in individual traits through time indicating deterministic successional processes associated with changing abiotic and/or biotic conditions. However, relative to the observed temporal rate of taxonomic turnover, both phylogenetic and functional turnover were comparatively low, suggesting a degree of functional redundancy among close relatives. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence indicating that limits to the similarity of coexisting species are rarely observed at fine spatial scales.},

abstract = {The survival of approximately 235 000 individual tropical trees and saplings in the 50 ha permanent plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama was analyzed over a 13-year interval (1982-1995) as a function of four biotic neighborhood variables: (i) total stem density; (ii) conspecific density; (iii) relative plant size; and (iv) relative species richness. These neighborhood variables were measured in annular rings of width 2.5 m, extending 30 m from a given focal plant, and in one more distant annulus at 47.5-50 m. Because survival was spatially autocorrelated, a Gibbs sampler and a Monte Carlo Markov chain method were used for fitting an autologistic regression model to obtain unbiased estimates of parameter variances for hypothesis testing. After pooling all species at the community level, results showed that all four variables had significant and often strong effects on focal plant survival. Three of the four variables had negative effects on focal plant survival; relative plant size was the only variable with a positive effect (18{\%} increase in the survival odds ratio). The variables with a negative effect on the survival odds ratio, in order of their effect strength in the nearest annulus, were: stem density (a 70{\%} reduction in the survival odds ratio), conspecific density (50{\%} reduction) and species richness (13{\%} reduction). A guild-level analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity among guilds in their responses to these variables. For example, survival of gap species showed a much larger positive response to relative plant size than did survival of shade-tolerant species. Survival of shrub species was positively affected by conspecific density, but canopy tree survival was negatively affected. Conspecific density negatively affected survival of rare species much more strongly than survival of common species. The neighborhood effects of conspecific density disappear within approximately 12-15 m of the focal plant. Although locally strong, the rapid spatial decay of these effects raises unanswered questions about their quantitative contribution to the maintenance of tree diversity on landscape scales in the BCI forest.},

abstract = {The accumulation of species-specific enemies around adults is hypothesized to maintain plant diversity by limiting the recruitment of conspecific seedlings relative to heterospecific seedlings. Although previous studies in forested ecosystems have documented patterns consistent with the process of negative feedback, these studies are unable to address which classes of enemies (for example, pathogens, invertebrates, mammals) exhibit species-specific effects strong enough to generate negative feedback, and whether negative feedback at the level of the individual tree is sufficient to influence community-wide forest composition. Here we use fully reciprocal shade-house and field experiments to test whether the performance of conspecific tree seedlings (relative to heterospecific seedlings) is reduced when grown in the presence of enemies associated with adult trees. Both experiments provide strong evidence for negative plant-soil feedback mediated by soil biota. In contrast, above-ground enemies (mammals, foliar herbivores and foliar pathogens) contributed little to negative feedback observed in the field. In both experiments, we found that tree species that showed stronger negative feedback were less common as adults in the forest community, indicating that susceptibility to soil biota may determine species relative abundance in these tropical forests. Finally, our simulation models confirm that the strength of local negative feedback that we measured is sufficient to produce the observed community-wide patterns in tree-species relative abundance. Our findings indicate that plant-soil feedback is an important mechanism that can maintain species diversity and explain patterns of tree-species relative abundance in tropical forests.},

Survival and growth probability of plants larger than 1 cm dbh (diameter at breast height), and recruitment into the 1-cm class, were assessed as a function of the number of conspecific neighbors in various distance and size classes. Density-dependent effects on survival and growth were strong in Faramea. Performance of 1-8 cm dbh plants declined with increasing numbers of adult neighbors within 1 m, 1-2 m, and 2-4 m, but neighbors at 4-6 m had no effect. Performance also declined with increasing numbers of juvenile neighbors lt 4 cm dbh, but the effect was less pronounced. Saplings of Faramea grew poorly in areas of high juvenile density within 30 m, independent of the effects caused by neighbors within 4 m. In contrast to Faramea, Desmopsis showed no density dependence in survival nor in growth. For recruitment, however, the two species showed similar patterns: recruit density was lower in regions with an adult conspecific within 1 or 2 m distance, but higher in regions with high densities of adult or juvenile conspecifics between 2 and 30-60 m. Desmopsis must have suffered density-dependent effects at stages lt 1 cm dbh, but the effect vanished by the 1 cm dbh stage. In Faramea, strong neighborhood effects were evident in all size classes lt 8 cm dbh.},

Furthermore, although density-dependent effects have been found at some life stages in some species, no study has shown that density-dependent recruitment affects community diversity. Here we report the results of observations in a lowland, moist forest in the Republic of Panam{\'{a}} in which the species identities of 386,027 seeds that arrived at 200 seed traps were compared with the species identities of 13,068 seedlings that recruited into adjacent plots over a 4-year period. Across the 200 sites, recruit seedling diversity was significantly higher than seed diversity. Part of this difference was explained by interspecies differences in average recruitment success. Even after accounting for these differences, however, negative density-dependent recruitment contributes significantly to the increase in diversity from seeds to seedling recruits.},

abstract = {Density-dependent seedling mortality could increase with a species relative abundance, thereby promoting species coexistence. Differences among species in light-dependent mortality also could enhance coexistence via resource partitioning. These compatible ideas rarely have been considered simultaneously. We developed models of mortality as functions of irradiance and local conspecific density (LCD) for seedlings of 53 tropical woody species. Species varied in mortality responses to these factors, but mortality consistently increased with shading and LCD. Across species, density-dependent mortality on a per-neighbour basis was inversely related to species community abundance, but higher LCD in more common species resulted in a weak relationship between species abundance and density-dependent mortality scaled to species maximum LCD. Species mortality responses to shading and maximum LCD were strongly and positively correlated. Our results suggest that species differences in density-dependent mortality are more strongly related to physiologically based life-history traits than biotic feedbacks related to community abundance.},

abstract = {Negative density dependence (NDD) and environmental filtering (EF) shape community assembly, but their relative importance is poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that seedling's mortality risk is positively related to the phylogenetic relatedness of neighbours. However, natural enemies, whose depredations often cause NDD, respond to functional traits of hosts rather than phylogenetic relatedness per se. To understand the roles of NDD and EF in community assembly, we assessed the effects on seedling mortality of functional similarity, phylogenetic relatedness and stem density of neighbouring seedlings and adults in a species-rich tropical forest. Mortality risks increased for common species when their functional traits departed substantially from the neighbourhood mean, and for all species when surrounded by close relatives. This indicates that NDD affects community assembly more broadly than does EF, and leads to the tentative conclusion that natural enemies respond to phylogenetically correlated traits. Our results affirm the prominence of NDD in structuring species-rich communities.},

Despite numerous experimental and phenomenological investigations, the extent to which such mechanisms operate in tropical forests remains unresolved because the demographical signature of density dependence has rarely been found in extensive investigations of established trees. This study used an individual-based demographical approach to investigate the role of conspecific and heterospecific neighbourhood crowding on tree mortality in a Panamanian and a Malayan tropical forest. More than 80{\%} of the species investigated at each site were found to exhibit density-dependent mortality. Furthermore, most of these species showed patterns of mortality consistent with the Janzen–Connell hypothesis and the rarely explored hypothesis of species herd protection. This study presents some of the first evidence of species herd protection operating in tree communities.},

Significant effects on recruitment, many extremely strong, are seen for 67 out of the 84 most common species in the plot, including the 10 most common. Significant effects on the intrinsic rate of increase are seen in 54 of the 84 species. These effects are far more common than interspecific effects, and are predominantly of the type that should maintain tree diversity. As a result, the more diverse an area in the forest is, the higher is the overall rate of increase of the trees in that area, although sheer crowding has by itself a negative effect. These findings are consistent with, but do not prove, an important role for host-pathogen interactions (defined broadly) in the maintenance of diversity. Ways are suggested by which to test host-pathogen models and competing models.},

abstract = {1.As trees in a given cohort progress through ontogeny, many individuals die. This risk of mortality is unevenly distributed across species because of many processes such as habitat filtering, interspecific competition and negative density dependence. Here, we predict and test the patterns that such ecological processes should inscribe on both species and phylogenetic diversity as plants recruit from saplings to the canopy. 2.We compared species and phylogenetic diversity of sapling and tree communities at two sites in French Guiana. We surveyed 2084 adult trees in four 1-ha tree plots and 943 saplings in sixteen 16-m2 subplots nested within the tree plots. Species diversity was measured using Fisher's alpha (species richness) and Simpson's index (species evenness). Phylogenetic diversity was measured using Faith's phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic richness) and Rao's quadratic entropy index (phylogenetic evenness). The phylogenetic diversity indices were inferred using four phylogenetic hypotheses: two based on rbcLa plastid DNA sequences obtained from the inventoried individuals with different branch lengths, a global phylogeny available from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and a combination of both. 3.Taxonomic identification of the saplings was performed by combining morphological and DNA barcoding techniques using three plant DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, rpoC1 and rbcLa). DNA barcoding enabled us to increase species assignment and to assign unidentified saplings to molecular operational taxonomic units. 4.Species richness was similar between saplings and trees, but in about half of our comparisons, species evenness was higher in trees than in saplings. This suggests that negative density dependence plays an important role during the sapling-to-tree transition. 5.Phylogenetic richness increased between saplings and trees in about half of the comparisons. Phylogenetic evenness increased significantly between saplings and trees in a few cases (4 out of 16) and only with the most resolved phylogeny. These results suggest that negative density dependence operates largely independently of the phylogenetic structure of communities. 6.Synthesis. By contrasting species richness and evenness across size classes, we suggest that negative density dependence drives shifts in composition during the sapling-to-tree transition. In addition, we found little evidence for a change in phylogenetic diversity across age classes, suggesting that the observed patterns are not phylogenetically constrained.},

By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species' sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospecific, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.},

abstract = {Many recent studies have searched to integrate species' functions and phylogenies in the measurement of biodiversity. To obtain easily interpretable measures, some researchers recommended diversity indices expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species: the number of equally likely and maximally dissimilar species needed to produce the given value of diversity. Then, biodiversity is often calculated at three scales: within communities ($\alpha$ diversity), among communities ($\beta$ diversity) and in a region ($\gamma$ diversity). These three scales are, however, insufficient to tackle the organization of biodiversity in space because, for most organisms, there is a nested hierarchy of multiple scales characterized by different patterns and processes, from the small neighbourhood to the biosphere. We developed methodologies for analysing species, functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity in a hierarchy of multiple scales using equivalent numbers of species. As an example, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Loire River, France, at four levels: within sites ($\alpha$ diversity), among sites within geological regions ($\beta$1 diversity), among geological regions ($\beta$2 diversity) and at the river scale ($\gamma$ diversity). The new hierarchical approaches of biodiversity revealed very low differences among sites within regions and among regions in terms of taxonomy and functional traits (size and diet), despite moderate, significant species turnover among geological regions. We compare our framework with those other authors have developed. We argue that different definitions of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ diversities are used in the literature reflecting different points of view on biodiversity. We make recommendations on how to normalize functional (or phylogenetic) dissimilarities among species to render sites and regions comparable, and discuss the pros and cons of our approach. The hierarchical approaches of biodiversity in terms of ‘equivalent numbers' respond to current demands to obtain intuitive, easily interpretable components of biodiversity. The approaches we propose go beyond current developments by considering a hierarchy of spatial scales and unbalanced sampling design. They will provide powerful tools to detect the ecological and evolutionary processes that act differently at different scales.},

abstract = {Question Understanding how the relative importance of different community assembly processes changes during secondary succession of diverse systems remains elusive. Functional and phylogenetic approaches that place species along continuous axes of niche differentiation and evolutionary relatedness, however, are deepening our understanding of the mechanisms that drive successional dynamics. We ask whether successional shifts in the functional and phylogenetic composition of post-agricultural tropical forests provide evidence for niche partitioning or competitive dominance hierarchies as drivers of successional change. Location Subtropical wet forests, Puerto Rico. Methods We combined data on four functional traits [leaf dry mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), maximum height (Hmax), seed dry mass] and a well-resolved molecular phylogeny to characterize taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition of sapling and adult tree communities along a regionally replicated chronosequence. We used a null model approach to assess how functional and phylogenetic diversity change with forest age. Results Corresponding increases of community-weighted mean LMA, Hmax and seed mass with forest age reflected a shift in dominance of species with acquisitive resource-use strategies and small seeds towards species with more conservative resource use and larger seeds. A negative relationship between forest age and local diversity of Hmax and seed mass suggested increased importance of competitive hierarchies for light capture and shade-tolerant regeneration in older forests. In contrast, the colonization of palms in older forest plots led to a positive relationship between forest age and local phylogenetic diversity, suggesting functional convergence of distantly related lineages on traits that confer competitive dominance under low resource conditions. Conclusions We linked both functional and phylogenetic dimensions of community diversity with successional trajectories of post-agricultural tropical forests. Contrasting patterns of these dimensions of diversity shed light on the underlying community assembly processes. We argue that integrating traits and phylogeny with specific hypotheses about physiological and historical mechanisms is essential for advancing our understanding of the drivers of community change during succession.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

Here, I summarize why UNTB generates confusion, and is not actually relevant to niche theory (i.e. an explanation for why and how many species coexist). Equal probability is not a theory, but lack of one; it does not include or exclude any process relevant to coexistence of competitors.

abstract = {Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species' threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1{\%} of the total number of all species described, and more than 1{\%} of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems – www.predicts.org.uk). We make site-level summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.},

abstract = {Despite long-standing interest in the origin and maintenance of species diversity, little is known about historical drivers of species assemblage structure at large spatiotemporal scales. Here, we use global species distribution data, a dated genus-level phylogeny, and paleo-reconstructions of biomes and climate to examine Cenozoic imprints on the phylogenetic structure of regional species assemblages of palms (Arecaceae), a species-rich plant family characteristic of tropical ecosystems. We find a strong imprint on phylogenetic clustering due to geographic isolation and in situ diversification, especially in the Neotropics and on islands with spectacular palm radiations (e.g., Madagascar, Hawaii, and Cuba). Phylogenetic overdispersion on mainlands and islands corresponds to biotic interchange areas. Differences in the degree of phylogenetic clustering among biogeographic realms are related to differential losses of tropical rainforests during the Cenozoic, but not to the cumulative area of tropical rainforest over geological time. A largely random phylogenetic assemblage structure in Africa coincides with severe losses of rainforest area, especially after the Miocene. More recent events also appear to be influential: phylogenetic clustering increases with increasing intensity of Quaternary glacial-interglacial climatic oscillations in South America and, to a lesser extent, Africa, indicating that specific clades perform better in climatically unstable regions. Our results suggest that continental isolation (in combination with limited long-distance dispersal) and changing climate and habitat loss throughout the Cenozoic have had strong impacts on the phylogenetic structure of regional species assemblages in the tropics.},

A lack of correlation between ecological gradients andSAD shape would suggest that SADs are caused by purely statistical reasons.We evaluated the variation in the shape of SADs for communities inlandscapes of differing variable connectivity, environmental heterogeneity,species niches overlap and productivity.Location Rainforests in the Madidi region (Bolivia).Methods We compiled biological and environmental information on 65 sites(a site being a group of two to six 0.1-ha plots where woody plants of adiameter at breast height  2.5 cm were inventoried). We built unveiled(complete) SADs for each site and fitted Gambin models to those SADs. TheGambin a parameter served as a metric of SAD shape. Low a valuescharacterize logseries-like SADs, while high a values characterize lognormal-like SADs. For each site, we estimated landscape roughness, environmentalheterogeneity, species niche overlap and productivity. These variables wererelated to SAD shape by means of variation partitioning.Results SADs changed from logseries-like to log normal-like along theelevational gradient. Many of our predictor variables were correlated: 40.4{\%} ofthe variation in SAD shape could not be attributed to specific factors.However, 50.62{\%} of the variation in the SAD shape could be assigned toindividual predictor matrices: 28.4{\%} was explained exclusively by nicheoverlap, 15.41{\%} exclusively by environmental heterogeneit y, 5.20{\%} exclusivelyby landscape roughness and 1.6{\%} exclusively by productivity.Main conclusions Ecological processes related to the topographical/environmental complexities that vary across the elevational gradient arecorrelated with the SAD shape.

abstract = {In the conservation literature on land-use change, it is often assumed that land-use intensification drives species loss, driving a loss of functional trait diversity and ecosystem function. Modern research, however, does not support this cascade of loss for all natural systems. In this paper we explore the errors in this assumption and present a conceptual model taking a more mechanistic approach to the species–functional trait association in a context of land-use change. We provide empirical support for our model's predictions demonstrating that the association of species and functional trait diversity follows various trajectories in response to land-use change. The central premise of our model is that land-use change impacts upon processes of community assembly, not species per se. From the model, it is clear that community context (i.e. type of disturbance, species pool size) will affect the response trajectory of the relationship between species and functional trait diversity in communities undergoing land-use change. The maintenance of ecosystem function and of species diversity in the face of increasing land-use change are complementary goals. The use of a more ecologically realistic model of responses of species and functional traits will improve our ability to make wise management decisions to achieve both aims in specific at-risk systems.},

abstract = {* Here, we incorporate facilitation into trait-based community assembly theory by testing two mutually compatible facilitative mechanisms: changes in the environmental filter, causing either an increase in the range of trait values (i.e. a range expansion effect) and/or a shift in trait distributions (i.e. a range shift effect); and changes in trait spacing, suggesting an effect on niche differentiation. * We analyzed the distribution of three functional traits – leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area and lateral spread – of plant communities dominated by a cushion-forming foundation species at four sites differing in elevation and aspect. * We found support for environmental filtering and niche differentiation mechanisms by cushions, with filtering effects (in particular range shifts) increasing with environmental severity at higher elevation. The effect size of cushions on trait distribution was similar to that of environmental gradients caused by elevation and aspect. The consideration of intraspecific trait variability improved the detection of cushion effects on trait distributions. * Our results highlight the importance of facilitation in the modification of taxonomic and functional diversity of ecological communities, and indicate that facilitation can occur through combined effects on environmental filtering and niche differentiation, with strong environmental context dependence of each mechanism.},

abstract = {Habitat patches that have been completely cleared of their original vegetation historically and subsequently recolonized naturally provide a useful study system to explore the importance of the processes involved in community assembly. Forests where the understorey vegetation is recovering from past agricultural land use form an iconic example of such a system. The colonization capacity of forest plant species into post-agricultural forests has been related to dispersal traits in previous comparative analyses, demonstrating the significance of dispersal limitation. Yet, none of them has evaluated evidence for a phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and, thus, explored the possibility that the dispersal traits are correlated with unmeasured establishment-related traits that are also shared through common ancestry. Here we analysed the colonization capacity of 330 species into post-agricultural forests across seven different landscapes in Europe and North America. With phylogenetic meta-analysis models we quantified the phylogenetic signal in colonization capacity and tested whether the colonization–dispersal trait relationships are confounded by phylogenetic non-independence. Closely related forest understorey species were more similar to one another in terms of their capacity to colonize post-agricultural forests than were more distantly related species. The correlations between dispersal traits and colonization were not independent from phylogeny. While we found some evidence of phylogenetic clustering of species' frequencies in post-agricultural communities, this was apparently not a result of strong filtering on dispersal traits. Synthesis – Given the phylogenetic signal in plant colonization capacity, a multitude of conserved species characteristics may explain community assembly in forests. Earlier trait-based syntheses strongly emphasised dispersal, but the factors limiting establishment and persistence of forest herbs in post-agricultural forests may be more nuanced than generally appreciated.

Another process now regularly classified as a neutral force, limited dispersal, represents a fundamental demographic process that is not neutral with respect to species differences, but rather differs among species in important ways.

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We describe a procedure for evaluating the relative importance of beta diversity, nestedness, and similarity properties of ecological data matrices containing density, cover or biomass scores of species. Our goals are achieved by extension of the simplex approach - originally proposed for presence-absence data - to abundances. Basically, the method involves decomposition of the Marczewski-Steinhaus coefficient of dissimilarity between pairs of sites into two fractions, one derived from differences between total abundance and the other from differences due to abundance replacement. These are contrasted by the similarity function counterpart, known as the Ruzicka coefficient, and are displayed graphically using ternary (or 2D simplex) plots. Interpretation is aided by calculating percentage contributions from these components to the (dis)similarity structure. Measures of replacement and nestedness are new for abundance data; these are considered complementary phenomena reflecting antithetic ecological processes that are analogous to those operating at the presence-absence level. The method is illustrated by artificial data and a range of actual ecological data sets representing different groups of organisms, different scales and different types of data. While the simplex diagrams and associated coefficients are meaningful by themselves, their comparison with presence-absence based results gives additional insight into data structure and background factors. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods We use theoretical and empirical examples to demonstrate that spe- cies distributions are non-random outcomes of first-order processes of biotic evolution: allopatry (isolation of populations), speciation and dispersion of biotas across landscapes. We then outline generalizable steps for integrating methods of phylogenetic and historical biogeographical analyses into studies of biotic assembly. Results We present a framework that can be applied to any biotic assemblage amenable to phylogenetic and historical biogeographical analyses, can accom- modate changes in spatial extent and temporal scale, and will facilitate compar- ison of assembly processes across biotas. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of an historical approach for providing context to ecological influences on evolutionary processes, such as trait evolution. Main conclusions By focusing on reconstructing the histories of individual lineages, an historical approach to assembly analysis can reveal the timing and underlying processes guiding biotic assembly, making it possible to disentangle the roles of history and ecology in the assembly process.},

More importantly, they make three recommendations for future research in metacommunity ecology to continue to advance this field: (i) the extension of empirical approaches to different and varied metacommunity systems; (ii) the integration of established metacommunity paradigms; and (iii) work incorporating meta-ecosystem and evolutionary mechanisms. These are important recommendations, but we think that their second recommendation is a necessary condition for the other two. We propose that a revision of the terminology used by Leibold et al. [2] can already accomplish part of this integration. Leibold et al.[2] proposed four paradigms of metacommunities: (i) neutral model; (ii) patch dynamics; (iii) mass effects; and (iv) species sorting, synthesizing concepts of intra- and intercommunity dynamics [2]. These four paradigms have formed the basis for the modern metacommunity concept, and much literature has characterized metacommunities based on the degree to which the systems conform to these paradigms (e.g. [2]). What the terminology of Leibold et al.[2] does not explicitly recognize is that two of these metacommunity paradigms (mass effects and patch dynamics) are actually special cases of the species-sorting paradigm. In the patch dynamics paradigm, the interacting species differ from each other, but in a very specific way. They specialize in their abilities as either competitors or colonizers within a uniform environment. Patches of varying species composition develop as species effectively colonize a site or outcompete other species. A second, less described, type of patch dynamics starts from a species-sorting setting, with environmental heterogeneity and associated species differences. Strong priority effects in such a system caused by dispersal limitation can lead to different and stable communities [3]. For the mass effects paradigm, source-sink dynamics enable species to exist at sites normally considered marginal or outside of their environmental range because high dispersal ensures a constant supply of new colonizers to these sites [2]. Therefore, these species have very different niche requirements, essentially a species-sorting framework, but dispersal maintains species in sites with negative growth rates. The only way to detect mass effects truly is to model or measure population growth rates of a species in an environment with and without dispersal. Thus, the distinguishing feature of a patch dynamic versus a species-sorting versus a mass effect framework is the amount of dispersal present between communities within a metacommunity: dispersal is limiting for some of the species in the patch dynamic framework, efficient for (the majority of) the species in a species-sorting framework, and high for some of the species in the mass effect framework. The terminology used by Leibold et al.[2] ensures consistency with the previous concepts in the literature. For example, terms such as 'patch dynamics' or 'mass effects' were already well documented in the literature before this work (e.g. [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Although we doubt that it was the intention of Leibold et al. [2] to suggest that these four paradigms were mutually exclusive or that each metacommunity system was uniquely associated with a single paradigm, the summary of research provided by Logue et al. [1] shows that work since 2004 has largely focused on delineating between the four paradigms (e.g. [8]). Indeed, Logue et al. [1] showed that the majority of observational metacommunity studies were aimed at testing for patch dynamics or mass effects. Thus, the terminology of the four paradigms ensures consistency over time, but continuing to use these terms while not explicitly recognizing, for instance, that patch dynamics and mass effects are special cases of the species-sorting paradigm does not address the actual relationships between the different paradigms. More importantly, these relationships illustrate the fundamental mechanistic processes responsible for metacommunities. We suggest that ecologists could move on from characterizing metacommunities as 'species sorting', 'patch dynamics', 'mass effects' or 'neutral model'. Rather, they should break these paradigms down and go back to the basics of thinking about what these paradigms mean for dispersal and environmental signals in metacommunities. This avoids the issue of having four discrete paradigms, and rather puts the focus on the relationships at play in metacommunities and how the mechanisms behind the patterns that describe each of the paradigms interact in a metacommunity. We thus propose to think about metacommunities as neutral, and species sorting with limiting (patch dynamics, sensu [2]), efficient (species sorting, sensu [2]), and high dispersal (mass effects, sensu [2]) as these terms capture the causal mechanisms and are, thus, more explicit.},

abstract = {Predicting ecosystem functioning at large spatial scales rests on our ability to scale up from local plots to landscapes, but this is highly contingent on our understanding of how functioning varies through space. Such an understanding has been hampered by a strong experimental focus of bio- diversity–ecosystem functioning research restricted to small spatial scales. To address this limitation, we investigate the drivers of spatial variation in multitrophic energy flux—a measure of ecosystem functioning in complex communities—at the landscape scale. We use a structural equation modelling framework based on distance matrices to test how spatial and environmental distances drive variation in community energy flux via four mechanisms: species composition, species richness, niche complementarity and biomass. We found that in both a tropical and a temperate study region, geographical and environmental distance indirectly influence species richness and biomass, with clear evidence that these are the dominant mechanisms explaining varia- bility in community energy flux over spatial and environmental gradients. Our results reveal that species composition and trait variability may become redundant in predicting ecosystem functioning at the landscape scale. Instead, we demonstrate that species richness and total biomass may best predict rates of ecosystem functioning at larger spatial scales.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is heterogeneously distributed across the Earth. A primary cause for this pattern is the heterogeneity in the amount of energy, or primary productivity (the rate of carbon fixed through photosynthesis), available to the biota in a given location. But the shape of the relationship between productivity and species diversity is highly variable. In many cases, the relationship is 'hump-shaped', where diversity peaks at intermediate productivity. In other cases, diversity increases linearly with productivity. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that data are often collected at different spatial scales. If the mechanisms that determine species diversity vary with spatial scale, then so would the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship. Here, we present evidence for scale-dependent productivity-diversity patterns in ponds. When the data were viewed at a local scale (among ponds), the relationship was hump-shaped, whereas when the same data were viewed at a regional scale (among watersheds), the relationship was positively linear. This dependence on scale results because dissimilarity in local species composition within regions increased with productivity.},

abstract = {1. The relationship between species richness and ecosystem function, as measured by productivity or biomass, is of long-standing theoretical and practical interest in ecology. This is especially true for forests, which repre- sent a majority of global biomass, productivity and biodiversity. 2. Here, we conduct an analysis of relationships between tree species richness, biomass and productivity in 25 forest plots of area 8–50 ha from across the world. The data were collected using standardized protocols, obvi- ating the need to correct for methodological differences that plague many studies on this topic. 3. We found that at very small spatial grains (0.04 ha) species richness was generally positively related to pro- ductivity and biomass within plots, with a doubling of species richness corresponding to an average 48{\%} increase in productivity and 53{\%} increase in biomass. At larger spatial grains (0.25 ha, 1 ha), results were mixed, with negative relationships becoming more common. The results were qualitatively similar but much weaker when we controlled for stem density: at the 0.04 ha spatial grain, a doubling of species richness corre- sponded to a 5{\%} increase in productivity and 7{\%} increase in biomass. Productivity and biomass were them- selves almost always positively related at all spatial grains. 4. Synthesis. This is the first cross-site study of the effect of tree species richness on forest biomass and productiv- ity that systematically varies spatial grain within a controlled methodology. The scale-dependent results are consis- tent with theoretical models in which sampling effects and niche complementarity dominate at small scales, while environmental gradients drive patterns at large scales. Our study shows that the relationship of tree species richness with biomass and productivity changes qualitatively when moving from scales typical of forest surveys (0.04 ha) to slightly larger scales (0.25 and 1 ha). This needs to be recognized in forest conservation policy and management.},

abstract = {Whether plant distributions are governed more by neutral-based distance effects or niche-based environmental responses remains elusive. A lack of habitat matching, where species distributions do not correspond to environmental variability, suggests neutrality but can also be explained by niche models through the interactions of dispersal limitation, spatial autocorrelation of the environment, species interactions, and spatial scale. We untangle these effects in a field study with multiscale statistical analyses. We demonstrate that despite significant niche-based environmental responses by a savanna plant, we still see weak habitat matching, with the mechanisms responsible differing by spatial scale. At the coarse scale (100-200 m), dispersal limitation restricted the occupation of optimal habitat. At the fine scale ({\textless}30 m), dispersal was not limiting, but a lack of autocorrelation of environmental variables prevented the aggregation of reproductively active plants in optimal microsites. Species associations were largely unimportant at all scales. Extending our analysis to the entire community revealed similar scale-dependent limitations of distance and the environment, indicating weak habitat matching for all species. This work supports predictions that environmental specializations do not necessarily produce deterministic distributions in plant communities. It also provides a mechanistic explanation for why co-occurring plant species can have largely undifferentiated distributions.},

We examined the effect of losing a single species on productivity and nitrogen retention in experimental grassland communities, concentrating on how these effects varied with the functional identity of the species lost and the diversity and composition of the community from which it was lost. In one experiment, we constructed random plant assemblages that varied in species richness to measure the effect of diversity alone on productivity and nitrogen retention. In another experiment, we constructed plant assemblages to assess the effects of deleting an individual plant species from assemblages differing in their functional and species richness and composition. On average, as species richness declined, productivity decreased but nitrogen retention was unaffected. However, the magnitude and direction of change in ecosystem functioning with declining diversity depended on the identity of the species deleted and the composition of the community from which it was deleted. The functional identity of a species predicted the type of impact its loss had on productivity, but not on nitrogen retention.},

Ninety plots were established in the Loess Plateau region of northern Shaanxi in China. The taxonomic and phylogenetic (alpha and beta) diversity were quantified within six succession stages. Null models were used to test whether phylogenetic distance observed differed from random expectations. Taxonomic beta diversity did not show a regular pattern, while phylogenetic beta diversity decreased throughout succession. The shrub stage occurred as a transition from phylogenetic overdispersion to clustering either for NRI (Net Relatedness Index) or betaNRI. The betaNTI (Nearest Taxon Index) values for early stages were on average phylogenetically random, but for the betaNRI analyses, these stages were phylogenetically overdispersed. Assembly of woody plants differed from that of herbaceous plants during late community succession. We suggest that deterministic and stochastic processes respectively play a role in different aspects of community phylogenetic structure for early succession stage, and that community composition of late succession stage is governed by a deterministic process. In conclusion, the long-lasting evolutionary imprints on the present-day composition of communities arrayed along the succession gradient.},

Increased sampling intensity consistently improved accuracy in estimating community- weighted means and variances of functional trait values, whereas there was substantial varia- tion among functional traits and minor differences among sampling strategies. 4. Thus, investment in intensified sampling yields a greater improvement in the accuracy of estimation than does an equivalent investment in sampling design complication. 5. Notably, ‘taxon-free' strategies frequently had greater accuracy than did abundance-based strategies, which had the additional cost of requiring botanical surveys. 6.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg Studies on phylogenetic community ecology usually infer habitat filtering when communities are phylogenetically clustered or competitive exclusion when communities are overdispersed. This logic is based on strong competition and niche similarity among closely related species—a less common phenomenon than previously expected. Dragonflies and damselflies are good models for testing predictions based on this logic because they behave aggressively towards related species due to mistaken identification of conspecifics. This behavior may drive communities toward phylogenetic overdispersion if closely related species frequently exclude each other. However, phylogenetically clustered communities could also be observed if habitat filtering and/or competitive asymmetry among distantly related species are major drivers of community assembling. We investigated the phylogenetic structure of odonate assemblages in central Brazil in a watershed characterized by variations in stream width, vegetation cover, aquatic vegetation, and luminosity. We observed general clustering in communities according to two indices of phylogenetic structure. Phylogenetic beta diversity coupled with Mantel tests and RLQ analysis evidenced a correlation between the riverine gradient and phylogenetic structure. Larger rivers with aquatic vegetation were characterized by anisopterans, while most zygopterans stayed in small and shaded streams. These results indicate niche conservatism in Odonata habitat occupancy, and that the environment is a major influence on the phylogenetic structure of these communities. We suggest that this is due to clade-specific ecophysiological requirements, and because closely related species may also have competitive advantages and dominate certain preferred habitats.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, it remains controversial whether ecological communities converge towards a common structure determined by environmental conditions irrespective of assembly history. Here, we show experimentally that the answer depends on the level of community organization considered. In a 9-year grassland experiment, we manipulated initial plant composition on abandoned arable land and subsequently allowed natural colonization. Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone. Our results show that the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects drives community assembly, making it both deterministic and historically contingent, but at different levels of community organization.},

abstract = {Trait analysis aims to understand relationships between traits, species di- versity, and the environment. Current methods could benefit from a model- based proba- bilistic framework that accommodates covariance between traits and quantifies contributions from inherent trait syndromes, species interactions, and responses to the environment. I develop a model- based approach that separates these effects on trait diversity. Application to USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern United States demon- strates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, infor- mation than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dom- inated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity. There is substantial variation in environmental control on trait patterns, between traits and regionally. In terms of environmental response traits do not aggregate into defined plant functional types, as would be desirable for models.},

abstract = {During the last decades, describing, analysing and understanding the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages has been a central theme in both community ecology and macro-ecology. Among the wide variety of phylogenetic structure metrics, three have been predominant in the literature: Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PDFaith), which represents the sum of the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree linking all species of a particular assemblage, the mean pairwise distance between all species in an assemblage (MPD) and the pairwise distance between the closest relatives in an assemblage (MNTD). Comparisons between studies using one or several of these metrics are difficult because there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the phylogenetic properties each metric captures. In particular it is unknown how PDFaith relates to MDP and MNTD. Consequently, it is possible that apparently opposing patterns in different studies might simply reflect differences in metric properties. Here, we aim to fill this gap by comparing these metrics using simulations and empirical data. We first used simulation experiments to test the influence of community structure and size on the mismatch between metrics whilst varying the shape and size of the phylogenetic tree of the species pool. Second we investigated the mismatch between metrics for two empirical datasets (gut microbes and global carnivoran assemblages). We show that MNTD and PDFaith provide similar information on phylogenetic structure, and respond similarly to variation in species richness and assemblage structure. However, MPD demonstrate a very different behaviour, and is highly sensitive to deep branching structure. We suggest that by combining complementary metrics that are sensitive to processes operating at different phylogenetic depths (i.e. MPD and MNTD or PDFaith) we can obtain a better understanding of assemblage structure.},

These hypotheses are often used to infer competitive dynamics from trait patterns within communities. However, plant traits are frequently plastic in response to competition. This variation is poorly accounted for in trait-based studies of competition and community assembly.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* To explore the relationship between trait responses and competitive outcomes, we grew 15 species alone, in monoculture and in mixture. We measured traits relating to leaf and root tissue morphology as well as biomass allocation and related competition-induced changes in these traits to intra- and interspecific competition using multi-model inference. Additionally, we tested how traits from different competitive environments influenced potential community assembly inferences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The competitive environment had large effects on species' traits, although many effects were species specific. Differences among species in how competition affected trait expression were linked to both intra- and interspecific competition, frequently affecting competitive hierarchies. Intraspecific competition was lower for species that limited competition-induced increases in root allocation and had less variability in this trait overall. Interspecific competition was lower for species with larger leaves and lower specific leaf area than their neighbours. Switching to more stress-tolerant strategies by increasing root diameter and leaf tissue density also reduced competition. However, dissimilarity in root tissue density also minimized competition, consistent with limiting similarity affecting competitive outcomes. Moreover, changes in these traits were linked to changes in functional diversity, suggesting that competition affects functional diversity by affecting trait expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Synthesis. Both trait hierarchies and trait dissimilarity affect the outcome of competition by acting on different traits, although competition-induced changes in trait expression can alter competitive outcomes. Moreover, the magnitude of these trait changes suggests that the source environment where plant traits are collected can affect the inferences drawn from trait patterns within communities. Combined, our results suggest that considering the effect of competition on trait expression is critical to understanding the relationship between traits and community assembly.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Variation in traits across species or populations is the outcome of both environmental and historical factors. Trait variation is therefore a function of both the phylogenetic and spatial context of species. Here we introduce a method that, within a single framework, estimates the relative roles of spatial and phylogenetic variations in comparative data. The approach requires traits measured across phylogenetic units, e.g. species, the spatial occurrences of those units and a phylogeny connecting them. The method modifies the expected variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts to include both spatial and phylogenetic effects. We illustrate this approach by analysing cross-species variation in body mass, geographical range size and species-typical environmental temperature in three orders of mammals (carnivores, artiodactyls and primates). These species attributes contain highly disparate levels of phylogenetic and spatial signals, with the strongest phylogenetic autocorrelation in body size and spatial dependence in environmental temperatures and geographical range size showing mixed effects. The proposed method successfully captures these differences and in its simplest form estimates a single parameter that quantifies the relative effects of space and phylogeny. We discuss how the method may be extended to explore a range of models of evolution and spatial dependence.},

abstract = {* Climate change is expected to increase the magnitude and the frequency of extreme climatic events such as droughts. Better understanding how plant communities will respond to these droughts is a major challenge. We expect the response to be a shift in functional trait values resulting from both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, but little research has addressed the relative contribution of both components. * We analysed the short-term functional response of subalpine grassland communities to a simulated drought by focusing on four leaf traits (LDMC: leaf dry matter content, SLA: specific leaf area, LNC: leaf nitrogen concentration and LCC: leaf carbon concentration). After evaluating species turnover and intraspecific variability separately, we determined their relative contribution in the community functional response to drought, reflected by changes in community-weighted mean traits. * We found significant species turnover and intraspecific variability, as well as significant changes in community-weighted mean for most of the traits. The relative contribution of intraspecific variability to the changes in community mean traits was more important (42–99{\%}) than the relative contribution of species turnover (1–58{\%}). Intraspecific variability either amplified (for LDMC, SLA and LCC) or dampened (for LNC) the community functional response mediated by species turnover. We demonstrated that the small contribution of species turnover to the changes in community mean LDMC and LCC was explained by a lack of covariation between species turnover and interspecific trait differences. * Synthesis. These results highlight the need for a better consideration of intraspecific variability to understand and predict the effect of climate change on plant communities. While both species turnover and intraspecific variability can be expected following an extreme drought, we report new evidence that intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short-term functional response of plant communities.},

abstract = {Question Revealing how plant traits vary over disparate spatial scales and how ecological processes mediate such variation is important for understanding plant community assembly. However, to what extent does the distribution of trait variation among ecological scales differ between leaf and wood tissues and between physical and chemical traits? What are the consequences of resource competition and/or habitat filtering on the community assembly with respect to differences between leaf and wood traits, and between physical and chemical traits? Location Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in five sites in the Ningbo area (29°41–50′ N, 121°36–52′ E) in eastern China. Methods Traits of 96 woody plant species were sampled and variation of ten physical- and chemical-based leaf and wood traits were partitioned across six ecological scales (site, plot, species, individual plant, twigs and leaf age) using a linear mixed model. Results From individual plant to site scales, variance partitions were distinct between leaf and wood traits. In leaf tissues, physical and chemical traits showed a consistent pattern, with the majority of variation found among species and individual plants, with little among plots. For wood tissues, the largest variation in physical traits was at the species and individual plant scales, with the largest variation in chemical traits observed at the plot scale. Variance partition was markedly similar within and across species. Conclusion Leaf and wood traits vary differently in relation to ecological scale, suggesting that trait variability is tissue-specific. The large variability of wood traits at the plot scale suggests a strong habitat filtering process. The large variation in leaf traits within plots may reflect niche differentiation across species and the importance of intra-specific variation that affects species co-existence. Our study demonstrated that physical and chemical traits may be independent. These decoupled trait axes may increase the dimensionality of niche space and facilitate species co-existence in forest communities.},

Conspecific seedling neighbour effects prevailed over the effects of larger conspecific and all heterospecific neighbours. Tolerance of seedling CNDD enhanced recruit survival and subsequent abundance, all of which were greater among larger seeded, slow-growing and well-defended species. Niche differentiation along the growth–survival trade-off and tolerance of seedling CNDD strongly correlated with regeneration success, with manifest consequences for community structure. The ability of larger seeded species to better tolerate CNDD suggests a novel mechanism for CNDD to contribute to seed-size variation and promote species coexistence through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off.},

abstract = {We use a two-species model of plant competition to explore the effect of intraspecific variation on community dynamics. The competitive ability ("performance") of each individual is assigned by an independent random draw from a species-specific probability distribution. If the density of individuals competing for open space is high (e.g., because fecundity is high), species with high maximum (or large variance in) performance are favored, while if density is low, species with high typical (e.g., mean) performance are favored. If there is an interspecific mean-variance performance trade-off, stable coexistence can occur across a limited range of intermediate densities, but the stabilizing effect of this trade-off appears to be weak. In the absence of this trade-off, one species is superior. In this case, intraspecific variation can blur interspecific differences (i.e., shift the dynamics toward what would be expected in the neutral case), but the strength of this effect diminishes as competitor density increases. If density is sufficiently high, the inferior species is driven to extinction just as rapidly as in the case where there is no overlap in performance between species. Intraspecific variation can facilitate coexistence, but this may be relatively unimportant in maintaining diversity in most real communities.},

abstract = {Trait-based approaches have an increasingly dominant role in community ecology. Although trait-based strategy dimensions such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) have been identified primarily at global-scales, trait variation at the community scale is often interpreted in this context. Here we argue from several lines of evidence that a research priority should be to determine whether global- scale trait relationships hold at more local scales. We review recent literature assessing trait variation at smaller scales, and then present a case study exploring the relationship between the correlation strength of leaf traits and their similarity in variation structure across ecological scales. We find that the correlation strength between pairs of leaf traits does not predict whether the traits respond similarly to different drivers of variation. Instead, correlation strength only sets an upper bound to the dissimilarity in trait variation structure. With moderate correlation strengths, LES traits largely retain the ability to respond independently to different drivers of phenotypic variation at different scales. Recent literature and our results suggest that LES relationships may not hold at local scales. Clarifying under what conditions and at which scales the LES is consistently expressed is necessary for us to make the most of the emerging trait toolbox.},

A lot of ecologists consider that this is unreasonable, because intraspecific variation significantly affects various ecological dynamics. However, it is not feasible to record the traits of each plant individually at every community site. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine in which circumstances it is most important to account for intraspecific trait variations. We conducted analyses using a trait-based niche–neutral continuum model integrating inter- and intraspecific variance. Then we tested the model through three popular community pattern indexes generated from four kinds of community assembly processes. The results showed that it was more important to consider intraspecific variations in plant communities with large niche overlaps. In such cases, including intraspecific variation increases the number of species and strongly affects the community's abundance structure. In contrast, when there is strong niche differentiation, the contribution of plant intraspecific variation could be neglected. In addition, the species richness and rank–abundance curve were insensitive to the magnitude of intraspecific variation, but plant trait distribution increased exponentially when intraspecific variation was included. Our results will be useful when designing field studies, to determine which data are most informative for various community types. {\textcopyright} 2015, Pakistan Botanical Society.

abstract = {Fire is a key determinant of tropical savanna structure and functioning. High fire frequencies are expected to assemble closely related species with a restricted range of functional trait values. Here we determined the effect of fire on phylogenetic and functional diversity of woody species and individuals in savanna communities under different fire frequencies. We found phylogenetic signals for one third of the functional traits studied. High numbers of fires simultaneously led to phylogenetic overdispersion and functional clustering when communities were represented by mean trait values with all traits that putatively should be affected or respond to fire. This finding is important, because it shows that the relationship between ecological processes and the phylogenetic structure of communities is not straightforward. Thus, we cannot always assume that close relatives are more similar in their ecological features. However, when considering a different set of traits representing different plant strategies (fire resistance/avoidance, physiological traits and regeneration traits), the results were not always congruent. When asking how communities are assembled in terms of individuals (not species) the outcome was different from the species-based approach, suggesting that the realised trait values - rather than mean species trait values - have an important role in driving community assembly. Thus, intraspecific trait variability should be taken into account if we want fully to improve our mechanistic understanding of assembly rules in plant communities. ?? 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

The presence of certain functional strategies along broad environmental gradients can help to understand the patterns observed in community assembly and the filtering mechanisms that take place. We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in aboveground (leaf and stem) and belowground (root) functional traits along environmental gradients in Mediterranean forest communities (south Spain). We proposed a new practical method to quantify the relative importance of species turnover (distinguishing between species occurrence and abundance) versus intraspecific variation, which allowed us to better understand the assemblage rules of these plant communities along environmental gradients. Our results showed that the functional structure of the studied plant communities was highly determined by soil environment. Results from our modelling approach based on maximum likelihood estimators showed a predominant influence of soil water storage on most of the community functional traits. We found that changes in community functional structure along environmental gradients were mainly promoted by species turnover rather than by intraspecific variability. Specifically, our new method of variance decomposition demonstrated that between-site trait variation was the result of changes in species occurrence rather than in the abundance of certain dominant species. In conclusion, this study showed that water availability promoted the predominance of specific trait values (both in above and belowground fractions) associated to a resource acquisition or conservation strategy. In addition, we provided evidence that changes on community functional structure along the environmental gradient were mainly promoted by a process of species replacement, which represent a crucial step towards a more general understanding of the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific trait variation in these woody Mediterranean communities.},

abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or "measurement error" as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of "phylogenetic signal," (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of "functional relations," such as reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.

abstract = {Aim To measure and quantify community phylogenetic structure to evaluate how evolutionary, ecological and biogeographic processes have shaped the distributions and assemblage of tropical and subtropical rain forest tree species across local, regional and continental scales. Location Australia. Methods We used 596 assemblage-level samples and 1137 woody species in rain forest vegetation sampled across two latitude regions (tropics and sub-tropics) and five distinct areas. Based on this dataset, we obtained and analysed species-level trait values (for leaf size, seed size, wood density and maximum height at maturity), measures of community phylogenetic structure and species turnover across space (beta) and evolutionary time (phylobeta). Results Phylobeta values showed that at continental scales (i.e. across the latitude regions combined) species replacement, as turnover in assemblages through time, was by more phylogenetically distant (i.e. less closely related) taxa. Within latitude regions replacement was by more closely related taxa. Assemblages of species were more phylogenetically clustered across the whole phylogeny (net relatedness index) and with respect to more recent divergences (nearest related taxon index) where the effects of historic disturbance (climatic oscillations) had been greater, and less clustered in long-term stable (refugial) locations. Local species composition in the stable wet tropics showed significant phylogenetic evenness, but there was no corresponding evenness in distributions of the ecological traits measured. Main conclusions Despite a shared evolutionary and biogeographic history, the two regions diverged from each other before the development of internal divergences. Phylogenetic evenness is more evident in long-term stable habitats (refugia) where species interact in conserved niches.Phylogenetic clustering is more evident where recolonization of more highly disturbed areas from historically reduced species pools reflects filtering of species into phylogenetically preferred habitats.},

abstract = {Environmental changes are expected to shift the distribution of functional trait values in plant communities through a combination of species turnover and intraspecific variation. The strength of these shifts may depend on the availability of individuals with trait values adapted to new environmental conditions, represented by the functional diversity (FD) of existing community residents or dispersal from the regional species pool. We conducted a 3-year nutrient- and seed-addition experiment in old-field plant communities to examine the contributions of species turnover and intraspecific variation to community trait shifts, focusing on four key plant functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We further examined the influence of initial FD and seed availability on the strength of these shifts. Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation. The strength of intraspecific shifts in height and leaf area was positively related to initial intraspecific FD in these traits. Intraspecific trait responses to fertilization varied among species, with species of short stature displaying stronger shifts in SLA and LDMC but weaker shifts in leaf area. Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses. Seed addition altered community taxonomic composition but had little effect on community trait shifts. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses and demonstrate that the strength of these responses may be mediated by community FD.},

abstract = {I show how phylogenetic correlograms track distinct microevolutionary processes and can be used as empirical descriptors of the relationship between interspecific covariance (V(B)) and time since divergence (t). Data were simulated under models of gradual and speciational change, using increasing levels of stabilizing selection in a stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, on a phylogeny of 42 species. For each simulated dataset, correlograms were constructed using Moran's I coefficients estimated at five time slices, established at constant intervals. The correlograms generated under different evolutionary models differ significantly according to F-values derived from analysis of variance comparing Moran's I at each time slice and based on Wilks' lambda from multivariate analysis of variance comparing their overall profiles in a two-way design. Under Brownian motion or with small restraining forces in the O-U process, correlograms were better fit by a linear model. However, increasing restraining forces in the O-U process cause a lack of linear fit, and correlograms are better described by exponential models. These patterns are better fit for gradual than for speciational modes of change. Correlograms can be used as a diagnostic method and to describe the V(B)/t relationship before using methods to analyze correlated evolution that assume (or perform statistically better when) this relationship is linear.},

abstract = {We derive a new metric of community similarity that takes into account the phylogenetic relatedness among species. This metric, phylogenetic community dissimilarity (PCD), can be partitioned into two components, a nonphylogenetic component that reflects shared species between communities (analogous to S{\o}rensen' s similarity metric) and a phylogenetic component that reflects the evolutionary relationships among nonshared species. Therefore, even if a species is not shared between two communities, it will increase the similarity of the two communities if it is phylogenetically related to species in the other community. We illustrate PCD with data on fish and aquatic macrophyte communities from 59 temperate lakes. Dissimilarity between fish communities associated with environmental differences between lakes often has a phylogenetic component, whereas this is not the case for macrophyte communities. With simulations, we then compare PCD with two other metrics of phylogenetic community similarity, II(ST) and UniFrac. Of the three metrics, PCD was best at identifying environmental drivers of community dissimilarity, showing lower variability and greater statistical power. Thus, PCD is a statistically powerful metric that separates the effects of environmental drivers on compositional versus phylogenetic components of community structure.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic structure analysis is a novel way to address the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes governing species assemblages. Here we investigate the phylogenetic structure of the vegetation of inselbergs located in the African rain forest. Inselbergs combine strong ecological gradients at the local scale due to soil depth variation and insular properties at the regional scale. They are therefore ideal models to assess the influence of ecological sorting and dispersal limitation on the phylogenetic structure of plant communities. On 21 inselbergs separated by up to 200 km where five microhabitat-types were recognized, 311 vegetation plots were inventoried. We found that floristic similarity between plots depended on both microhabitat differentiation and spatial distance, while phylogenetic clustering (i.e. excess of phylogenetic similarity between species from a same plot) only appeared between plots from differentiated microhabitats and increased with ecological distance. Within a microhabitat-type, the absence of phylogenetic structure between inselbergs indicates that species turnover is probably due to dispersal limitation rather than to regional-scale variations in environmental factors. Hence, phylogenetic structure analysis can help disentangle the effects of ecological sorting and dispersal limitation on species assemblages. To estimate the time-scale of the processes generating the phylogenetic structure, we investigated how lineage similarity changes with increasing age in the phylogenetic tree. High lineage similarity levels between ecologically very differentiated plots were only reached at the proximity of the root of the phylogenetic tree. This was observed even when considering only plots sharing no species and indicates that phylogenetic niche conservatism has been important for generating the observed phylogenetic structure. Hence, ancient diversification exerts an impact on the assembly of current plant communities.},

abstract = {1. Deforestation and forest fragmentation can drive species to local extinction, potentially changing the phylogenetic community structure and diversity of remaining assemblages. We tested this hypothesis analysing a large vegetation data set from a highly fragmented rain forest. 2. We assessed 9000 trees (both saplings and adults) from 268 species in 45 rain forest patches (ranging from{\textless} 1 to 700 ha) in three landscapes with different deforestation levels (4{\%}, 11{\%}, and 24{\%}forest cover) in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We tested whether species density (i.e. number of species per unit area) and phylogenetic structure and diversity differed among landscapes, whether they were related to patch area, and whether the relationships differed among landscapes. 3. Overall, the observed differences in sapling and adult species densities across forest patches and landscapes (e.g. lower species densities in smaller patches) resulted in few and very weak changes in the phylogenetic community structure and diversity. Our results indicate that local extirpation of tree species may occur randomly or uniformly (but not in a clustered manner) throughout the phylogenetic tree, supporting the hypothesis of low phylogenetic conservatism of traits associated with vulnerability to forest fragmentation in the Neotropics. 4. Synthesis. This study indicates that in highly deforested and fragmented rain forests, the local extirpation of tree species does not occur across entire lineages. These novel and hopeful findings have direct implications for the ecology and conservation of fragmented rain forests. The maintenance of phylogenetic diversity in highly fragmented landscapes suggests that ecosystem function and stability may be maintained despite the loss of a number of tree species. We argue that in this unique Neotropical region, both large and small rain forest patches are critical for conserving regional tree evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Closely related species that occur together in commu- nities and experience similar environmental conditions are likely to share phenotypic traits because of the process of environmental fil- tering. At the same time, species that are too similar are unlikely to co-occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida, we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species, their degree of co-occurrence within com- munities and niche overlap across environmental gradients, and their similarity in ecophysiological and life-history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co-occurring spe- cies are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the white?live oak clades than only members of one clade. This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits im- portant for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence.We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida},

abstract = {Consideration of the scale at which communities are defined both taxonomi-cally and spatially can reconcile apparently contradictory results on the extent to which plants show phylogenetic niche conservatism. In plant communities in north central Florida, we collected species abundances in 55 0.1-ha plots in several state parks. When communities were defined narrowly to include a single phylogenetic lineage, such as Quercus, Pinus, or Ilex, neighbors tended to be less related than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion) or there was no pattern. If the same communities were defined more broadly, such as when all seed plants were included, neighbors tended to be more related than expected (phylogenetic clustering). These results provide evidence that species interactions among close relatives influence community structure, but they also show that niche conservatism is increasingly evident as communities are defined to include greater phylogenetic diversity. We also found that, as the spatial scale is increased to encompass greater environmental heterogeneity, niche conservatism emerges as the dominant pattern. We then examined patterns of trait evolution in relation to trait similarity within communities for 11 functional traits for a single phylo-genetic lineage (Quercus) and for all woody plants. Among the oaks, convergent evolution of traits important for environmental filtering contributes to the observed pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion. At the broader taxonomic scale, traits tend to be conserved, giving rise to phylogenetic clustering. The shift from overdispersion to clustering can be explained by the increasing conservatism of traits at broader phylogenetic scales.},

As a tool for future comparative studies, we compiled a supertree of angiosperm families from published phylogenetic studies. Sequence data from the plastid rbcL gene were used to estimate relative timing of branching events, calibrated by using robust fossil dates. The frequency of shifts in diversification rate is largely constant among time windows but with an apparent increase in diversification rates within the more recent time frames. Analyses of species numbers among families revealed that diversification rate is a labile attribute of lineages at all levels of the tree. An examination of the top 10 major shifts in diversification rates indicates they cannot easily be attributed to the action of a few key innovations but instead are consistent with a more complex process of diversification, reflecting the interactive effects of biological traits and the environment.},

Phylogenetic niche conservatism has important consequences for the assembly of both local communities and the regional species pools from which these are drawn. If corridors for movement are available, newly emerging environments will tend to be filled by species that filter in from areas in which the relevant adaptations have already evolved, as opposed to being filled by in situ evolution of these adaptations. Examples include intercontinental disjunctions of tropical plants, the spread of plant lineages around the Northern Hemisphere after the evolution of cold tolerance, and the radiation of northern alpine plants into the Andes. These observations highlight the role of phylogenetic knowledge and historical biogeography in explanations of global biodiversity patterns.

abstract = {1. Analyzing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes gov-erning the assembly and coexistence of species. For instance, an association between species co-occurrence in local communities and their phylogenetic proximity may reveal the action of habitat filtering, niche conservatism and/or competitive exclusion. 2. Different methods were recently proposed to test such community-wide phylogenetic patterns, based on the phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion of the species in a local community. This pro-vides a much needed framework for addressing long standing questions in community ecology as well as the recent debate on community neutrality. The testing procedures are based on (i) a metric measuring the association between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence, and (ii) a data set randomization algorithm providing the distribution of the metric under a given 'null model'. However, the statistical properties of these approaches are not well-established and their reliability must be tested against simulated data sets. 3. This paper reviews metrics and null models used in previous studies. A 'locally neutral' subdi-vided community model is simulated to produce data sets devoid of phylogenetic structure in the spatial distribution of species. Using these data sets, the consistency of Type I error rates of tests based on 10 metrics combined with nine null models is examined. 4. This study shows that most tests can become liberal (i.e. tests rejecting too often the null hypoth-esis that only neutral processes structured spatially the local community) when the randomization algorithm breaks down a structure in the original data set unrelated to the null hypothesis to test. Hence, when overall species abundances are distributed non-randomly across the phylogeny or when local abundances are spatially autocorrelated, better statistical performances were achieved by randomization algorithms preserving these structural features. The most reliable randomization algorithm consists of permuting species with similar abundances among the tips of the phylogenetic tree. One metric, R PD-DO , also proved to be robust under most simulated conditions using a variety of null models. 5. Synthesis . Given the suboptimal performances of several tests, attention must be paid to the test-ing procedures used in future studies. Guidelines are provided to help choosing an adequate test.},

abstract = {1 Analysing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes governing the assembly and coexistence of species in ecological communities.2 Unifying previous works, we present a statistical framework to quantify the phylogenetic structure of communities in terms of average divergence time between pairs of individuals or species, sampled from different sites. This framework allows an additive partitioning of the phylogenetic signal into alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) components, and is closely linked to Simpson diversity. It unifies the treatment of intraspecific (genetic) and interspecific diversity, leading to the definition of differentiation coefficients among community samples (e.g. I-ST, P-ST) analogous to classical population genetics coefficients expressing differentiation among populations (e.g. F-ST, N-ST).3 Two coefficients which express community differentiation among sites from species identity (I-ST) or species phylogeny (P-ST) require abundance data (number of individuals per species per site), and estimators that are unbiased with respect to sample size are given. Another coefficient (Pi(ST)) expresses the gain of the mean phylogenetic distance between species found in different sites compared with species found within sites, and requires only incidence data (presence/absence of each species in each site).4 We present tests based on phylogenetic tree randomizations to detect community phylogenetic clustering (P-ST {\textgreater} I-ST or Pi(ST) {\textgreater} 0) or phylogenetic overdispersion (P-ST {\textless} I-ST or Pi(ST) {\textless} 0). In addition, we propose a novel approach to detect phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in different clades or at different evolutionary time depths using partial randomizations.5 I-ST, P-ST or Pi(ST) can also be used as distances between community samples and regressed on ecological or geographical distances, allowing us to investigate the factors responsible for the phylogenetic signal and the critical scales at which it appears.6 We illustrate the approach on forest tree communities in Equatorial Guinea, where a phylogenetic clustering signal was probably due to phylogenetically conserved adaptations to the elevation gradient and was mostly contributed to by ancient clade subdivisions.7 The approach presented should find applications for comparing quantitatively phylogenetic patterns of different communities, of similar communities in different regions or continents, or of populations (within species) vs. communities (among species).},

abstract = {Biodiversity studies aim to explain spatiotemporal patterns of species distributions. We propose a new methodology in which trait diversity is measured by the quadratic entropy index, with distances among species calculated from differences among trait states. We show how this index of trait diversity can be decomposed among the nodes of a phylogenetic tree. The contribution to trait diversity of a particular node is equal to the trait diversity among the n groups of species descending from it multiplied by an abundance weight (either proportional to the number of descendant species or to their relative abundance). We developed three tests to characterize the phylogenetic pattern of trait diversity and evaluated our methodology with seven evolutionary models. The power of the tests was high and increased with the number of extant taxa and the number of traits analyzed. The Type I error analyses (erroneous rejection of true null hypotheses) suggested that our tests are neither too liberal nor too conservative. Species abundances were found to modify the phylogenetic signal in trait diversity if only a few species were abundant and if species abundances were correlated to their phylogenetic relatedness and/or their trait states. By comparing phylogenetic signals in trait diversity from the local to the metacommunity level, we explored the factors that structure butterfly trait diversity in calcareous grasslands of northern France and southern Belgium. We show that partial phylogenetic signal in traits combined with habitat filtering determined which species and lineages were able to co-occur locally. Interestingly, no phylogenetic signal was detected when measures of abundance were included in our analyses. For most species and clades, the abundance distribution among communities at the regional scale was random. Overall, studying trait diversity in a phylogenetic context allows the link between current local ecological processes and lineage-dependent historical evolutionary factors to be thoroughly investigated.},

abstract = {Because of the correlation expected between the phylogenetic relatedness of two taxa and their net ecological similarity, a measure of the overall phylogenetic relatedness of a community of interacting organisms can be used to investigate the contemporary ecological processes that structure community composition. I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees ({\textgreater}/=10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

We propose an integrative framework linking ecological theory, empirical data and statistical models to understand the distribution of species and their abundances together with the underlying community assembly dynamics. We illustrate our approach with 21 plant species in the French Alps. We show that a spatially nested modelling framework significantly improves the model's performance and that the spatial variations of species presence-absence and abundances are predominantly explained by different factors. We also show that incorporating abiotic, dispersal and biotic factors into the same model bring new insights to our understanding of community assembly. This approach, at the crossroads between community ecology and biogeography, is a promising avenue for a better understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity distribution.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity and its evolution may help evolutionary rescue in a novel and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals cryptic genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity. However, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may alter these predictions because high plasticity may amplify phenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments, they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question here by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a model with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal autocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of long-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and compare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk. We find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces persistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This understanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the emergence of chemical resistance in pests.},

abstract = {Although the effects of variation between individuals within species are traditionally ignored in studies of species coexistence, the magnitude of intraspecific variation in nature is forcing ecologists to reconsider. Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species-level competitive differences or substituting for species-level niche differences. These arguments, which are motivating a large body of empirical work, have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging, (2) changes in species' mean interaction strengths because of variation in underlying traits (also via nonlinear averaging) and (3) effects on stochastic demography. As a consequence of the first two mechanisms, we find that intraspecific variation in competitive ability increases the dominance of superior competitors, and intraspecific niche variation reduces species-level niche differentiation, both of which make coexistence more difficult. In addition, individual variation can exacerbate the effects of demographic stochasticity, and this further destabilises coexistence. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for emerging empirical interests in the effects of intraspecific variation on species diversity.},

Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average.

We explored the drivers of within-and between-species variation of aboveground biomass allocation across a strong environmental resource gradient, i.e., a long-term chronosequence of 30 forested islands in northern Sweden across which soil fertility and plant productivity declines while light availability increases. For each of the three coexisting dominant understory dwarf shrub species on each island, we estimated the fraction of the total aboveground biomass produced year of sampling that was allocated to sexual reproduction (i.e., fruits), leaves and stems for each of two growing seasons, to determine how biomass allocation responded to the chronosequence at both the within-species and whole community levels. Against expectations, within-species allocation to fruits was least on less fertile islands, and allocation to leaves at the whole community level was greatest on intermediate islands. Consistent with expectations, different coexisting species showed contrasting allocation patterns, with the species that was best adapted for more fertile conditions allocating the most to vegetative organs, and with its allocation pattern showing the strongest response to the gradient. Our study suggests that co-existing dominant plant species can display highly contrasting biomass allocations to different aboveground organs within and across species in response to limiting environmental resources within the same plant community. Such knowledge is important for understanding how community assembly, trait spectra, and ecological processes driven by the plant community vary across environmental gradients and among contrasting ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition of the need to incorporate intraspecific trait variability (ITV) into trait-based studies to improve understanding of community assembly and how plant communities drive ecosystem processes. However, most studies have focused on ITV across plant communities, with few quantifying it at local scales. Further, little is known about how ITV at local scales differs among communities or across environmental gradients. Here, we studied a well characterized 5000-year-old chronosequence involving 30 islands that differed greatly in size, soil fertility, spatial heterogeneity, and species diversity. On each island we measured foliar and litter (including nutrient resorption) traits for ten individuals for each of three species that occur on all islands, i.e., Betula pubescens, Vaccinum myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. For each trait for each species we estimated its within-island mean, and coefficient of variation as a measure of local scale ITV. We predicted within-island ITV should be highest for larger islands that have the greatest spatial heterogeneity of soil resources but lowest species diversity. Further, we predicted that the species most dominant in the most resource heterogeneous environment (V. myrtillus) should have the greatest within-island ITV. First, we found that within-island ITV of foliar traits was generally unresponsive to island size, while for litter traits it was responsive to island size only for V. myrtillus in a direction consistent with our prediction. The within-island ITV of resorption efficiency of C, N and P for the three species was often responsive to island size, but not in a consistent direction. Second, against our prediction, V. myrtillus had the lowest within-island ITV for most traits, but its within-island ITV was generally more responsive than that of the other species to island size. While plant traits are well known to vary among and within species at broad spatial scales across environmental gradients, our results show that at local scales, ITV can also be highly responsive to fine scale environmental gradients, particularly for litter and nutrient resorptive traits. Understanding how local scale ITV varies across communities offers opportunities for improving our understanding of what drives community assembly, functional diversity and ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Kumordzi et al.},

Are the major resource$\backslash$neconomics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait$\backslash$nvariability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species$\backslash$nranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be$\backslash$ndiscriminated by their leaf traits?$\backslash$n2. Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine$\backslash$ncatchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant$\backslash$nspecies with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations$\backslash$nfrom a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each$\backslash$nspecies across their ranges.$\backslash$n3. With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait$\backslash$nanalyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific$\backslash$nvariability to overall functional trait variability (similar to 30{\%}).$\backslash$nAlthough not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and$\backslash$nstrategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to$\backslash$nalter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than$\backslash$na clear-cut species classification.$\backslash$n4. Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be$\backslash$nconsidered as negligible - species being represented by mean trait$\backslash$nvalues -, or not - species being represented by multivariate trait$\backslash$ndistributions -, is an essential question for multiple ecological$\backslash$nissues. However, this decision cannot be generic, but will depend on the$\backslash$nstudied system and selected traits and species, as well as on study$\backslash$nobjectives.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits - specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height - in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait-gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability. 3. Community mean SLA and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively, of these trait-gradient relationships. LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters. We argue that community ecology would benefit from more attention to intraspecific variability.},

@article{Kazakou2014,
abstract = {Questions: One central assumption of trait screening approaches in comparative plant ecology, i.e. simultaneous measurement of traits on a large number of species or populations, is that the species level captures a major part of trait variation. The current development of large databases has led to a new screening approach that relies on the extraction of trait values from databases, rather than onmeasurement of traits in the field.We tested this assumptionwith the following questions: (1) is the magnitude of intra-specific variability of co-occurring species lower than inter-specific variability for a given trait, in comparisons at different spatial scales; (2) is species hierarchy based on trait values conserved across different spatial scales and data sets (stable species hierarchy hypothesis); and (3) when we compare different traits, what is the more stable trait that is conserved across different spatial scales and data sets? Methods: We combined approaches commonly used in functional ecology, i.e. experimental data, field observations and extraction of data from a global database, and analysed the magnitude of intra-specific and inter-specific trait variations for a large number of traits across contrasting environmental conditions for 18–39 (mostly) herbaceous species, according to the data set used. Results: For most traits, inter-specific variability was higher than intra-specific variability, and species ranking was conserved across different data sets and spatial scales. However, we also detected important differential responses in terms of intra-specific trait variability, depending on the trait examined: SLA, LDMC, SM, seed N concentration and onset of flowering weremore stable, whereas leaf chemical traits and RHweremore flexible traits. Conclusions: Our study validated, for the species studied, the stable species hierarchy hypothesis in the case of several, but not all, widely used traits. The main conclusion is that the strength of the species signal is strong enough for some traits to allowvalues to be used fromdifferent data sets (experiments, databases) to characterize local populations of species: for SM, seed N concentration, RH, SLA and LDMC.},

abstract = {Writing Scientific Research Articles is designed for early-career researchers in the sciences: those who are relatively new to the task of writing their research results as a manuscript for submission to an international refereed journal, and those who want to develop their skills for doing this more efficiently and successfully. All scientists are faced with pressure to publish their results in prestigious journals and all face challenges when trying to write and publish. This book takes a practical approach to developing scientists' skills in three key areas necessary for success: . developing strategy: understanding what editors and referees want to publish, and why; . developing story: understanding what makes a compelling research article in a particular discipline area; and . using language: developing techniques to enhance clear and effective commu- nication with readers in English. The skills required for successful science writing are both science- and language- based, and skill integration is required for efficient outcomes. We are an author team of a scientist and a research communication teacher who have combined our perspectives and experience to produce an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to the task of article writing. We have written the book both for those who write science in English as their first language and those for whom English is an additional language (EAL). Although a very high proportion of the research articles published worldwide currently appears in English, scientific research is an intensely international and intercultural activity in the twenty-first century, and authors come from a wide range of language and cultural backgrounds. This situation adds another layer to the challenges facing authors themselves, journal editors and referees, and those who teach and support EAL scientists. We hope the book will be relevant to all professionals involved with the practice of research article writing. The book is designed for use either by individuals as a self-study guide, or by groups working with a teacher or facilitator. Readers can prepare their own manuscript step by step as they move through the book, or use the book as a preparation phase and return to relevant parts when the time comes to write their own paper and navigate the publishing process. Web support for the book is available at www.writeresearch.com.au, with additional examples and links to other resources. The book has arisen out of fruitful collaborations at the University of Adelaide over many years, and especially out of our work with the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2001. There are many people to thank for their contributions both to the approach and the book. First on the language end of the continuum must be Robert Weissberg and Suzanne Buker, whose 1990 book Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report Writing for Students of English laid such an effective foundation in using the insights of the worldwide community of genre-analysis researchers as the basis of effective teaching about research article writing. Next are John Swales and his colleagues over the years, for their research output, their teaching texts, and their modeling of humble and rigorous curiosity as an effective way into the worlds of other disciplines. Then the team at Adelaide that has built from these bricks a context where the book could emerge: especially Kate Cadman, Ursula McGowan, and Karen Adams, and so many scientists over the years. For bringing the perspective and experience of scientists, particular thanks go to those who have taught with us in China: Andrew Smith, Brent Kaiser, Scott Field, Bill Bellotti, Anne McNeill, and Murray Unkovich. We also thank those who have supported the training programs where we have refined our practical teaching approach, particularly Yongguan Zhu and Jinghua Cao. And, of course, the many early-career authors, in Australia, Vietnam, Spain, and China, who have participated in our workshops and contributed their insights and enthusiasm to the development of the book. Our warm thanks go also to the people who have helped with the production of the book itself: Sally Richards, Karen Adams, Marian May, and our editors at Wiley-Blackwell, Delia Sandford and Ward Cooper. Remaining errors and omissions must be down to us.},

abstract = {The last decades have seen an upsurge in ecological studies incorporating phylogenetic information with increasing species samples, motivated by the common conjecture that species with common ancestors should share some ecological characteristics due to niche conservatism. This has been carried out using various methods of increasing complexity and reliability: using only taxonomical classification; constructing supertrees that incorporate only topological information from previously published phylogenies; or building supermatrices of molecular data that are used to estimate phylogenies with evolutionary meaningful branch lengths. Although the latter option is more informative than the others, it remains under-used in ecology because ecologists are generally unaware of or unfamiliar with modern molecular phylogenetic methods. However, a solid phylogenetic hypothesis is necessary to conduct reliable ecological analysis integrating evolutive aspects. Our aim here is to clarify the concepts and methodological issues associated with the reconstruction of dated megaphylogenies, and to show that it is nowadays possible to obtain accurate and well sampled megaphylogenies with informative branch-lengths on large species samples. This is possible thanks to improved phylogenetic methods, vast amounts of molecular data available from databases such as Genbank, and consensus knowledge on deep phylogenetic relationships for an increasing number of groups of organisms. Finally, we include a detailed step-by-step workflow pipeline (Supplementary material), from data acquisition to phylogenetic inference, mainly based on the R environment (widely used by ecologists) and the use of free web-servers, that has been applied to the reconstruction of a species-level phylogeny of all breeding birds of Europe.},

abstract = {While studying ecological patterns at large scales, ecologists are often unable to identify all collections, forcing them to either omit these unidentified records entirely, without knowing the effect of this, or pursue very costly and time-consuming efforts for identifying them. These "indets" may be of critical importance, but as yet, their impact on the reliability of ecological analyses is poorly known. We investigated the consequence of omitting the unidentified records and provide an explanation for the results. We used three large-scale independent datasets, (Guyana/ Suriname, French Guiana, Ecuador) each consisting of records having been identified to a valid species name (identified morpho-species - IMS) and a number of unidentified records (unidentified morpho-species - UMS). A subset was created for each dataset containing only the IMS, which was compared with the complete dataset containing all morpho-species (AMS: = IMS + UMS) for the following analyses: species diversity (Fisher's alpha), similarity of species composition, Mantel test and ordination (NMDS). In addition, we also simulated an even larger number of unidentified records for all three datasets and analyzed the agreement between similarities again with these simulated datasets. For all analyses, results were extremely similar when using the complete datasets or the truncated subsets. IMS predicted ≥91{\%} of the variation in AMS in all tests/analyses. Even when simulating a larger fraction of UMS, IMS predicted the results for AMS rather well. Using only IMS also out-performed using higher taxon data (genus-level identification) for similarity analyses. Finding a high congruence for all analyses when using IMS rather than AMS suggests that patterns of similarity and composition are very robust. In other words, having a large number of unidentified species in a dataset may not affect our conclusions as much as is often thought.},

abstract = {* Increasingly, ecologists are using functional and phylogenetic approaches to quantify the relative importance of stochastic, abiotic filtering and biotic filtering processes shaping the pattern of species co-occurrence. A remaining challenge in functional and phylogenetic analyses of tropical tree communities is to successfully integrate the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree communities across spatial and size scales and habitats in a single analysis. * We analysed the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree assemblages in a 20-ha tropical forest dynamics plot in south-west China. Because the influence of biotic interactions may become more apparent as cohorts age, on local scales, and in resource-rich environments, we perform our analyses across three size classes, six spatial scales and six distinct habitat types, using 10 plant functional traits and a molecular phylogeny for the {\textgreater}400 tree taxa found in the plot. * All traits, except leaf area and stem-specific resistance, had significant, albeit weak phylogenetic signal. For canopy species, phylogenetic clustering in small and medium size classes turned to phylogenetic overdispersion in the largest size class and this change in dispersion with size was found in each habitat type and across all spatial scales. On fine spatial scales, functional dispersion changed from clustering to overdispersion with increasing size classes. However, on larger spatial scales assemblages were functionally clustered for all size classes and habitats. * Phylogenetic and functional structure across spatial and size scales and habitats gave strong support for a deterministic model of species co-occurrence rather than for a neutral model. The results also support the hypothesis that abiotic determinism is more important at larger scales, while biotic determinism is more important on smaller scales within habitats.},

The rapid development of this field can be attributed to the merging of phylogenetics and community ecology research to provide improved clarity on the processes that govern community structure and composition. Question: What are the major challenges that impede the sound interpretation of the patterns and processes of phylogenetic community assembly? Methods: We use four scenarios to illustrate explicitly how the phylogenetic structure of communities can exist in stable or transient phases, based on the different combinations of phylogenetic relationships and phenotypic traits among co-occurring species. We discuss these phases by implicating a two-way process in the assembly and disintegration of the given ecological community. Conclusions: This paper synthesizes the major concepts of community phylogenetics using habitat filtering and competition processes to elucidate how the understanding of phylogenetic community structure is currently hindered by the dynamics of community assembly and disassembly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Charlotte Ndiribe.},

Answering this question requires framing an analysis on the frontier between species distribution modelling (SDM), which ignores biotic interactions and dispersal limitation, and community ecology, which provides specific predictions on community and meta-community structure and resulting diversity patterns such as species richness and functional diversity. Using both empirical and simulated datasets, we tested whether predicted occurrences from fine-resolution SDMs provide good estimates of community structure and diversity patterns at resolutions ranging from a resolution typical of studies within reserves (250 m) to that typical of a regional biodiversity study (5 km). For both datasets, we show that the imprint of biotic interactions and dispersal limitation quickly vanishes when spatial resolution is reduced, which demonstrates the value of SDMs for tracking the imprint of community assembly processes across scales.},

We revisit Fauth et al.'s conclusion and discuss how the use of these terms has changed over time since their review. An updated analysis of term definition from a selection of popular ecological textbooks suggests that definitions have drifted away from those encountered pre-1996, and slightly disagreed with results from a survey of 100 ecology professionals (comprising of academic professors, nonacademic PhDs, graduate and undergraduate biology students). Results suggest that confusion about these terms is still widespread in ecology. We conclude with clear suggestions for definitions of each term to be adopted hereafter to provide greater cohesion among research groups. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by John Wiley},

abstract = {The problem of scale dependency is widespread in investigations of ecological communities. Null model investigations of community assembly exemplify the challenges involved because they typically include subjectively defined "regional species pools." The burgeoning field of community phylogenetics appears poised to face similar challenges. Our objective is to quantify the scope of the problem of scale dependency by comparing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages across contrasting geographic and taxonomic scales. We conduct phylogenetic analyses on communities within three tropical forests, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to two scaleable inputs: taxonomy and species pool size. We show that (1) estimates of phylogenetic overdispersion within local assemblages depend strongly on the taxonomic makeup of the local assemblage and (2) comparing the phylogenetic structure of a local assemblage to a species pool drawn from increasingly larger geographic scales results in an increased signal of phylogenetic clustering. We argue that, rather than posing a problem, "scale sensitivities" are likely to reveal general patterns of diversity that could help identify critical scales at which local or regional influences gain primacy for the structuring of communities. In this way, community phylogenetics promises to fill an important gap in community ecology and biogeography research.},

abstract = {The study of biodiversity has tended to focus primarily on relatively information poor measures of species diversity. Recently, many studies of local diversity (alpha diversity) have begun to use measures of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity. Investigations into the phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity (beta diversity) of communities have been far less numerous, but these dissimilarity measures have the potential to infer the mechanisms underlying community assembly and dynamics. Here we relate levels of phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity to levels of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity to infer the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the assembly of tree communities in six forests located in tropical and temperate latitudes. The results show that abiotic filtering plays a role in structuring local assemblages and governing spatial turnover in community composition and that phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity are not strong predictors of functional alpha and beta diversity in the forests studied.},

abstract = {The competition-relatedness hypothesis (CRH) predicts that the strength of competition is the strongest among closely related species and decreases as species become less related. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that common ancestry causes close relatives to share biological traits that lead to greater ecological similarity. Although intuitively appealing, the extent to which phylogeny can predict competition and co-occurrence among species has only recently been rigorously tested, with mixed results. When studies have failed to support the CRH, critics have pointed out at least three limit- ations: (i) the use of data poor phylogenies that provide inaccurate estimates of species relatedness, (ii) the use of inappropriate statistical models that fail to detect relationships between relatedness and species interactions amidst nonlinearities and heteroskedastic variances, and (iii) overly simplified labora- tory conditions that fail to alloweco-evolutionary relationships toemerge.Here, we address these limitations and find they do not explain why evolutionary relatedness fails to predict the strength of species interactions or probabilities of coexistence among freshwater green algae. First, we construct a new data- rich, transcriptome-based phylogeny of common freshwater green algae that are commonly cultured and used for laboratory experiments. Using this new phylogeny,we re-analyse ecological data from three previously published lab- oratory experiments. After accounting for the possibility of nonlinearities and heterogeneity of variances across levels of relatedness,we find no relationship between phylogenetic distance and ecological traits. In addition, we show that communities of North American green algae are randomly composed with respect to their evolutionary relationships in 99{\%} of 1077 lakes spanning the continental United States. Together, these analyses result in one of the most comprehensive case studies of how evolutionary history influences species interactions and community assembly in both natural and experimental sys- tems. Our results challenge the generality of the CRH and suggest it may be time to re-evaluate the validity and assumptions of this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Changes in the chemical composition of soil organic carbon (SOC) might strongly affect the global carbon cycle as it controls the SOC decomposition rate. Vegetation change associated with long-term land use changes is known to strongly impact the chemical composition of SOC; however, data on the impacts of vegetation change following disturbance events of short durations and succession that occur frequently in forest ecosystems via diverse management objectives on SOC chemical composition are negligible. Here we examined the impacts of vegetation changes on the chemical composition of SOC by sampling soils of native broad-leaved forests, planted mixed broad-leaved and coniferous forests, and tea gardens in eastern China. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify SOC chemical composition. We found that among all components of SOC chemical composition, alkyl carbon (C) and aryl C were more liable to change with vegetation than other SOC components. Soil pH was negatively correlated to the relative abundances of alkyl C and N-alkyl C, and Shannon's index of overstory plant species was positively correlated to the relative abundances of phenolic C and aromaticity. Our results suggest that vegetation changes following short disturbance events and succession may strongly alter SOC chemical composition in forest ecosystems. Globally, soil organic carbon (SOC) amounts to approximately 2,344 Gt, making it the largest terrestrial carbon (C) pool 1–3 . Even small changes in SOC pool decomposition might make significant changes in the atmospheric carbon (C) concentration 4 , and could lead to a strong positive feedback to climate change 5 . SOC decomposition rates are strongly associated with its chemical composition 6 , with decomposition rates decreasing from O-alkyl C to alkyl C 7,8 . Thus, shifts in SOC chemical composition affect SOC stabilization 9,10 . The input of C to the soil profile is determined by C allocation, decomposition, and production 11 . Vegetation change associated with long-term land use changes may result in SOC chemical compositional shifts 12–14 . For example, when natural forests were converted to hoop pine plantations, O-alkyl C decreased and alkyl C increased 13 . After native shrub lands were converted to chestnut plantations, both alkyl C and O-alkyl C decreased 14 . Vegetation change and the corresponding management may alter soil aggregates, which influ-ence SOC chemical composition 6 . It also leads to lignin variation, which consequently impacts the yield of lignin-derived phenols and carboxyl 15 . Vegetation change affects lignin degradation through alterations in soil texture 11 , and increased yields of phenolic CuO oxidation products 15 . The soil texture consequently affects car-bohydrates 16 , and O-alkyl C (mainly carbohydrate) was found be predominate in the larger fractions, whereas alkyl carbon (primarily polymethylene) dominated the clay fractions 17 . The influence of vegetation change and the corresponding management toward the initiation of changes in lignin and carbohydrates might be attributed to particular microbes 18,19 . As a result of the different growth characteristics and nutrient demands of specific microbial groups, the changes in lignin and carbohydrates may favor the growth of certain microbial groups over others 20 . Variations in SOC chemical composition associated with vegetation change might be attributed to the different patterns of mineralization of plant-derived microbial carbohydrate inputs 15,21 . However, it remains unclear whether vegetation change following disturbance events of short durations, which frequently occur natu-rally or via diverse management objectives in forest ecosystems, affects the chemical composition of SOC. We sampled forest soils from native broadleaf forests, mixed evergreen broadleaved and coniferous forests, and tea gardens in Fengyang Mountain nature reserve, Zhejiang Province, China, to examine the impact of 1},

abstract = {Functional diversity within communities may influence ecosystem functioning, but which factors drive functional diversity? We hypothesize that communities assembled from many phylogenetic lineages show large functional diversity if assembly is random, but low functional diversity if assembly is controlled by interactions between species within lineages. We combined {\textgreater} 9000 descriptions of Dutch plant communities, a species-level phylogeny, and information on 16 functional traits (including eight dispersal traits). We found that all traits were conserved within lineages, but nevertheless communities assembled from many lineages showed a smaller variation in trait-states of most traits (including dispersal traits) than communities assembled from few lineages. Hence, within lineages, species are not randomly assembled into communities, contradicting Neutral Theory. In fact, we find evidence for evolutionary divergence in trait-states as well as present-day mutual exclusion among related, similar species, suggesting that functional diversity of communities increased due to past and present interactions between species within lineages.},

abstract = {Amazonian tree species vary enormously in their total abundance and range size, while Amazonian tree genera vary greatly in species richness. The drivers of this variation are not well understood. Here, we construct a phylogenetic hypothesis that represents half of Amazonian tree genera in order to contribute to explaining the variation. We find several clear, broad-scale patterns. Firstly, there is significant phylogenetic signal for all three characteristics; closely related genera tend to have similar numbers of species and similar mean range size and abundance. Additionally, the species richness of genera shows a significant, negative relationship with the mean range size and abundance of their constituent species. Our results suggest that phylogenetically correlated intrinsic factors, namely traits of the genera themselves, shape among lineage variation in range size, abundance and species richness. We postulate that tree stature may be one particularly relevant trait. However, other traits may also be relevant, and our study reinforces the need for ambitious compilations of trait data for Amazonian trees. In the meantime, our study shows how large-scale phylogenies can help to elucidate, and contribute to explaining, macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns in hyperdiverse, yet poorly understood regions like the Amazon Basin.},

abstract = {Aim Ecologists have long been concerned with understanding how local communities are assembled from the pool of species present in the broader biogeographical region. Although there has been considerable interest in the use of measures of species relatedness as tools to detect community assembly process, empirical and simulation studies have produced mixed results on the effectiveness of the technique. Here, we ask how well the most commonly used metrics of such community phylogenetic patterns detect the operation of filtering and competition in simulated communities where filtering and competition determine species abundances as well as co-occurrence patterns. Location Simulated local communities assembled from a simulated regional species pool. Methods We simulate the evolution of niche traits for a regional species pool on a phylogeny, and then simulate the assembly of a local community from this regional species pool using a Lotka–Volterra model. We then test whether the net relatedness index (NRI) or the nearest taxon index (NTI) can detect the assembly process. We compare the performance of abundance-weighted (NRIAW and NTIAW) and occurrence-based (NRIO and NTIO) versions of the metrics along a gradient of local community size as a percentage of the regional pool. Results We find that abundance weighting can substantially increase the power to detect assembly processes. Moreover, clustering and over-dispersion are, in fact, most detectable when assembly processes act mainly on abundance rather than occurrence. Where they differed, NTIAW tended to outperform NRIAW at detecting limiting-similarity competition. NRIAW outperformed NTIAW at detecting filtering except when filtering was very strong compared with limiting-similarity competition. Main conclusions Our findings imply that phylogenetic information is more likely to yield information about community assembly when abundance information is incorporated, and local communities contain a relatively large fraction of the regional species pool.},

Biodiversity is suggested to positively influence multiple services but evidence from natural systems at scales relevant to management is scarce. Here, across a scale of 400,000 km(2), we report that tree species richness in production forests shows positive to positively hump-shaped relationships with multiple ecosystem services. These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50{\%} greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of production forests will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain the full range of benefits that the society obtains from forests.},

abstract = {Forests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1 ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1 ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i.e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer.},

abstract = {The processes causing the latitudinal gradient in species richness remain elusive. Ecological theories for the origin of biodiversity gradients, such as competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics, and environmental filtering, make predictions for how functional diversity should vary at the alpha (within local assemblages), beta (among assemblages), and gamma (regional pool) scales. We test these predictions by quantifying hypervolumes constructed from functional traits representing major axes of plant strategy variation (specific leaf area, plant height, and seed mass) in tree assemblages spanning the temperate and tropical New World. Alpha-scale trait volume decreases with absolute latitude and is often lower than sampling expectation, consistent with environmental filtering theory. Beta-scale overlap decays with geographic distance fastest in the temperate zone, again consistent with environmental filtering theory. In contrast, gamma-scale trait space shows a hump-shaped relationship with absolute latitude, consistent with no theory. Furthermore, the overall temperate trait hypervolume was larger than the overall tropical hypervolume, indicating that the temperate zone permits a wider range of trait combinations or that niche packing is stronger in the tropical zone. Although there are limitations in the data, our analyses suggest that multiple processes have shaped trait diversity in trees, reflecting no consistent support for any one theory.},

Especially noticeable effect has been attained in the field of microbial ecology, where new experimental approaches provided in-depth assessments of the composition, functions, and dynamic changes of complex microbial communities. Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amounts of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyze and interpret these datasets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular dataset. In this review we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive, and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world. Finally, we offer suggestions for the selection of appropriate methods based on the research question and dataset structure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many studies show that species richness is correlated with climate, especially among local sites within a region. However, few studies have addressed how these climate– diversity relationships actually arise. Only a few processes can directly change species richness (i.e., speciation, extinction, dispersal), and these processes may be best studied by incorporating a phylogenetic perspective. Here, we used a phylogenetic approach to address the causes of climate–diversity relationships in plethodontid salamanders by combining data on richness, climate, and phylogeny for 250 species. Our results suggest that species richness patterns in plethodontids are explained primarily by how long each region and climatic zone has been occupied, rather than by the effects of either area, species density (i.e., ecological limits), or climate on the rates of speciation or extinction. Across regions, diversity is related to time rather than climate. Within regions, significant climate–diversity relationships are also related to time, with higher richness in climatic regimes that have been occupied longer. Although some might think that phylogeny is unimportant at local scales and when climate and diversity are strongly correlated, we show that niche conservatism and phylogenetic history (time) combine to create species pools of different sizes in different habitats (climatic regimes), leading to variation in local species richness across these habitats within a region.},

abstract = {Patterns of diversity and community composition in forests are controlled by a combination of environmental factors, historical events, and stochastic or neutral mechanisms. Each of these processes has been linked to forest community assembly, but their combined contributions to alpha and beta-diversity in forests has not been well explored. Here we use variance partitioning to analyze {\~{}}40?000 individual trees of 49 species, collected within 137 ha of sampling area spread across a 900-ha temperate deciduous forest reserve in Pennsylvania to ask (1) To what extent is site-to-site variation in species richness and community composition of a temperate forest explained by measured environmental gradients and by spatial descriptors (used here to estimate dispersal-assembly or unmeasured, spatially structured processes)? (2) How does the incorporation of land-use history information increase the importance attributed to deterministic community assembly? and (3) How do the distributions and abundances of individual species within the community correlate with these factors? Environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and distance to stream), spatial descriptors (i.e., spatial eigenvectors derived from Cartesian coordinates), and land-use history variables (i.e., land-use type and intensity, forest age, and distance to road), explained about half of the variation in both species richness and community composition. Spatial descriptors explained the most variation, followed by measured environmental variables and then by land-use history. Individual species revealed variable responses to each of these sets of predictor variables. Several species were associated with stream habitats, and others were strictly delimited across opposing north- and south-facing slopes. Several species were also associated with areas that experienced recent (i.e., {\textless}100 years) human land-use impacts. These results indicate that deterministic factors, including environmental and land-use history variables, are important drivers of community response. The large amount of ?unexplained? variation seen here (about 50{\%}) is commonly observed in other such studies attempting to explain distribution and abundance patterns of plant communities. Determining whether such large fractions of unaccounted for variation are caused by a lack of sufficient data, or are an indication of stochastic features of forest communities globally, will remain an important challenge for ecologists in the future.},

abstract = {Local communities are assembled from larger-scale species pools via dispersal, environmental filtering, biotic interactions, and local stochastic demographic processes. The relative importance, scaling and interplay of these assembly processes can be elucidated by comparing local communities to variously circumscribed species pools. Here we present the first study applying this approach to forest tree communities across East Asia, focusing on community phylogenetic structure and using data from a global network of tropical, subtropical and temperate forest plots. We found that Net Relatedness Index (NRI) and Nearest Taxon Index (NTI) values were generally lower with geographically broad species pools (global and Asian species pools) than with an East Asian species pool, except that global species pool produced higher NTI than the East Asian species pool. The lower NRI for the global relative to the East Asian species pool may indicate an important role of intercontinental migration during the Neogene and Quaternary and climatic conservatism in shaping the deeper phylogenetic structure of tree communities in East Asia. In contrast, higher NTI for the global relative to the East Asian species pool is consistent with recent localized diversification determining the shallow phylogenetic structure. T he recent integration of phylogeny and community ecology is bridging the gap between biogeography and ecology, providing novel insights for ecological and biogeographic theory, notably as regards the relative roles of local and regional factors in community assembly 1–4 . Importantly, the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis, which proposes that communities in low-latitude warm areas are dominated by older clades than communities in high-latitude cold regions, has been developed and supported by studies linking phylogenies to local communities 5–8 . The tropical niche conservatism hypothesis suggests that most lineages originated in the warm tropics and have been limited in their ability to disperse into the colder areas because of temperature niche conservatism 5 . When linking phylogenies to local communities for describing community phylogenetic structure 9 , geographic scope is crucial 10 . Notably, estimates of community phylogenetic structure involve comparing realized commun-ity to null-model communities 1 . A geographic scope is needed for defining the null model, i.e., how far beyond the local community does one go in the null-model sampling, and varying it may provide insights on community assembly 10 . Importantly, the choice of geographic scope for the species pool may shed light on the scale of the diversification and migration processes by which the communities have been built 9,10},

abstract = {AimsEnvironmental gradients are drivers of species diversity; however, we know relatively little about the evolutionary processes underlying these relationships. A potentially powerful approach to studying diversity gradients is to quantify the phylogenetic structure within and between assemblages arrayed along broad spatial and environmental gradients. Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages along an environmental gradient with the expectation that the habitat specialization of entire lineages is an important evolutionary pattern influencing the structure of tree communities along environmental gradients. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of several environmental variables on the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages in 145 plots distributed in northwestern South America that cover a broad environmental gradient. The phylogenetic alpha diversity was quantified for each plot and the phylogenetic beta diversity between each pair of plots was also quantified. Both the alpha and beta diversity measures were then related to spatial and environmental gradients in the study system. Important FindingsWe found that gradients in temperature and potential evapotranspiration have a strong relationship with the phylogenetic alpha diversity in our study system, with phylogenetic overdispersion in low temperatures and phylogenetic clustering at higher temperatures. Further, the phylogenetic beta diversity between two plots increases with an increasing difference in temperature, whereas annual precipitation was not a significant predictor of community phylogenetic turnover. We also found that the phylogenetic structure of the plots in our study system was related to the degree of seasonal flooding and seasonality in precipitation. In particular, more stressful environments such as dry forests and flooded forests showed phylogenetic clustering. Finally, in contrast with previous studies, we find that phylogenetic beta diversity was not strongly related to the spatial distance separating two forest plots, which may be the result of the importance of the three independent mountain ranges in our study system, which generate a high degree of environmental variation over very short distances. In conclusion, we found that environmental gradients are important drivers of both phylogenetic alpha and phylogenetic beta diversities in these forests over spatial distance.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological community can provide insights into the relative importance of different processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP, and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from 10 x 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities, the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats. In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats, but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has several possible explanations, including variation in the strength of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will need to include information on species traits in order to explain the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Functional trait-based approaches have seen rapid development in community ecology and biogeography in recent years, as they promise to offer a better mechanistic and predictive understanding of community structure. However, several key challenges remain. First, while many studies have explored connections between functional traits and abiotic gradients, far fewer have directly tested the common assumption that functional trait differences influence interspecific interactions. Second, empirical studies often ignore intraspecific trait variation within communities, even though intraspecific variation has been known to have substantial impacts on community dynamics. Here we present an experiment designed to assess the role of functional trait differences in predicting the outcome of interspecific species interactions among a suite of California vernal pool annual plants. Eight species were grown in pairwise combinations in two levels of inundation in a greenhouse and functional traits were measured on all individuals. Nested models predicting focal plant performance were fit to the data. For seven of the eight species in the experiment, the best model included a functional trait difference term that was consistent with a competitive hierarchy, indicating that focal species tended to do better when they had larger leaf size, lower specific leaf area, and greater investment in lateral canopy spread than their neighbors. Models that included individually measured trait values generally performed better than models using species trait averages. We tested if the same trait measurements predicted tolerance of inundation (a feature of vernal pool habitats), and species depth distributions from extensive field surveys, though we did not find strong relationships. Our results suggest that functional traits can be used to make inferences about the outcome of interspecific interactions, and that greater predictive power can come from considering intraspecific variation in functional traits, particularly in low diversity communities.},

Conclusion: is a concept of PNC scientifically useful? 961 Acknowledgements 692 References 692 SUMMARY: Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) is the tendency of lineages to retain their niche-related traits through speciation events. A recent surge in the availability of well-sampled molecular phylogenies has stimulated phylogenetic approaches to understanding ecological processes at large geographical scales and through macroevolutionary time. We stress that PNC is a pattern, not a process, and is found only in some traits and some lineages. At the simplest level, a pattern of PNC is an inevitable consequence of evolution - descent with modification and divergence of lineages - but several intrinsic causes, including physicochemical, developmental and genetic constraints, can lead directly to a marked pattern of PNC. A pattern of PNC can also be caused indirectly, as a by-product of other causes, such as extinction, dispersal limitation, competition and predation. Recognition of patterns of PNC can contribute to understanding macroevolutionary processes: for example, release from constraint in traits has been hypothesized to trigger adaptive radiations such as that of the angiosperms. Given the multiple causes of patterns of PNC, tests should address explicit questions about hypothesized processes. We conclude that PNC is a scientifically useful concept with applications to the practice of ecological research.},

abstract = {The consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem services largely depend on the functional identities of extirpated species. However, poor descriptions of spatial patterns of community functional composition across landscapes hamper accurate predictions, particularly in highly diverse tropical regions. Therefore, understanding how community functional composition varies across environmental gradients remains an important challenge. We sampled 15 functional traits in 800 Neotropical tree species across 13 forest plots representative of the broad climatic and soil gradients encompassed by three widespread lowland forest habitats (terra firme forests on clay-rich soils, seasonally flooded forests and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (Peru and French Guiana). We combined univariate and multivariate approaches to test the magnitude and predictability of environmental filtering on community leaf and wood functional composition. Directional shifts in community functional composition correlated with environmental changes across the 13 plots, with denser leaves, stems and roots in forests occurring in environments with limited water and soil-nutrient availability. Critically, these relationships allowed us to accurately predict the functional composition of 61 additional forest plots from environmental data alone. Synthesis. Environmental filtering consistently shapes the functional composition of highly diverse tropical forests at large scales across the terra firme, seasonally flooded and white-sand forests of lowland Amazonia. Environmental factors drive and allow the prediction of variation in community functional composition among habitat types in Amazonian forests. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

In phase II (this article), a linear model of coregionalization (LMC)$\backslash$r$\backslash$nis fitted by estimated generalized least squares to the direct and cross experimental variograms of residuals (i.e., after$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe removal of estimated drifts). Structural correlations and coefficients of determination at smaller scales are then computed$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom the estimated coregionalization matrices, while the estimated drifts are used to calculate pseudo coefficients at large$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscale. The performance of five procedures in estimating correlations and coefficients of determination was compared using$\backslash$r$\backslash$na Monte Carlo study. In four CRAD procedures, drift estimation was based on local polynomials of order 0, 1, 2 (L0, L1, L2) or a global polynomial with forward selection of the basis functions; the fifth procedure was coregionalization analysis$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(CRA), in which large-scale patterns were modeled as a supplemental component in the LMC. In bivariate and multivariate analyses,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe uncertainty in the estimation of correlations and coefficients of determination could be related to the interference between$\backslash$r$\backslash$nspatial components within a bounded sampling domain. In the bivariate case, most procedures provided acceptable estimates$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof correlations. In regionalized redundancy analysis, uncertainty was highest for CRA, while L1 provided the best results overall. In a forest ecology example, the identification of scale-specific correlations between$\backslash$r$\backslash$nplant species diversity and soil and topographical variables illustrated the potential of CRAD to provide unique insight into$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe functioning of complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {While there is good evidence linking animal introductions to impacts on native communities via disease emergence, our understanding ofhowsuch impacts occur is incomplete. Invasion ecologists have focused on the disease risks to native communities through ‘‘spillover'' of infectious agents introduced with nonindigenous hosts, while overlooking a potentially more common mechanism of impact, that of ‘‘parasite spillback.'' We hypothesize that parasite spillback could occur when a nonindigenous species is a competent host for a native parasite, with the presence of the additional host increasing disease impacts in native species. Despite its lack of formalization in all recent reviews of the role of parasites in species introductions, aspects of the invasion process actually favor parasite spillback over spillover.Wespecifically review the animal-parasite literature and show that native species (arthropods, parasitoids, protozoa, and helminths) account for 67{\%} of the parasite fauna of nonindigenous animals from a range of taxonomic groups. Weshow that nonindigenous species can be highly competent hosts for such parasites and provide evidence that infection by native parasites does spillback from nonindigenous species to native host species, with effects at both the host individual and population scale. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of parasite spillback as a potential threat to native species, discuss possible reasons for its neglect by invasion ecologists, and identify future research directions.},

Understanding the predictors and drivers of phenological change is therefore critical. 3. Here we evaluated evidence for phylogenetic conservatism – the tendency for closely related species to share similar ecological and biological attributes – in phenological traits across flowering plants. We aggregated published and unpublished data on timing of first flower and first leaf, encompassing {\~{}}4000 species at 23 sites across the Northern Hemisphere. We reconstructed the phylogeny for the set of included species, first, using the software program Phylomatic, and second, from DNA data. We then quantified phylogenetic conservatism in plant phenology within and across sites. 4. We show that more closely related species tend to flower and leaf at similar times. By contrasting mean flowering times within and across sites, however, we illustrate that it is not the time of year that is conserved, but rather the phenological responses to a common set of abiotic cues. 5. Our findings suggest that species cannot be treated as statistically independent when modeling phenological responses. 6. Synthesis. Closely related species tend to resemble each other in the timing of their life history events, a likely product of evolutionarily conserved responses to environmental cues. The search for the underlying drivers of phenology must therefore account for species' shared evolutionary histories.},

abstract = {That competition is stronger among closely related species and leads to phylogenetic overdispersion is a common assumption in community ecology. However, tests of this assumption are rare and field-based experiments lacking. We tested the relationship between competition, the degree of relatedness, and overdi-spersion among plants experimentally and using a field survey in a native grassland. Relatedness did not affect competition, nor was competition associated with phylogenetic overdispersion. Further, there was only weak evidence for increased overdispersion at spatial scales where plants are likely to compete. These results challenge traditional theory, but are consistent with recent theories regarding the mechanisms of plant competition and its potential effect on phylogenetic structure. We suggest that specific conditions related to the form of competition and trait conservatism must be met for competition to cause phyloge-netic overdispersion. Consequently, overdispersion as a result of competition is likely to be rare in natural communities.},

abstract = {The distribution of traits within communities is thought to provide information on the evolutionary and ecological forces that structure community composition. Ecological character displacement (evolutionary divergence among populations of interacting species within a community), as well as community-wide character displacement (even dispersion of species traits within a community via species sorting), have been widely reported and are typically interpreted as evidence for interspecific competition. However, defining an appropriate null distribution with which to assess the observed distribution of traits within a community has proved controversial. Phylogenetic methods provide an alternative approach to evaluating community structure, but such methods also require an appropriate null and have typically overlooked the potential for evolutionary dynamics within communities. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic framework that uses evolutionary expectations to generate a simple null model of the expected distribution of traits among co-occurring species. Using a stochastic Brownian motion model of trait change, we illustrate that the expected community- wide dispersion of traits varies with phylogenetic tree shape. We then use data on body mass for mammals to evaluate the accuracy with which phylogeny can predict the empirical distribution of traits and find a strong correlation between predicted and observed trait distributions. We suggest that deviations from phylogenetic expectations may therefore provide a useful tool for evaluating the role of competition in shaping community structure. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using empirical data on body mass and a phylogeny for a small community of terrestrial mammals in Yotvata, Israel, and reveal evidence consistent with ecological and community-wide character displacement. Our method unites ecological and evolutionary approaches, and it provides a novel framework for exploring community structure.},

abstract = {Fire is a major force driving the evolution of plants and the structure and function of ecosystems globally. It thus likely operates as an important environmental filter that selects for species that have evolved to tolerate and depend on fire. Across a 40-year experimental fire gradient from frequently burned open savanna to unburned dense woodland in Minnesota, USA, we examined the relationships among community assembly, evolutionary history, and functional trait composition. Close relatives had similar abundance patterns across the fire gradient, providing evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in fire adaptation and highlighting the importance of shared ancestry in predicting species responses to fire. Phylogenetic beta diversity was greatest between the most extreme fire treatments across the gradient, indicating that species in the most contrasting fire regimes were most distantly related. Fire strongly influenced diversity, co-occurrence patterns, and leaf trait means and variances within communities. The most frequently burned communities had the highest species richness, exhibited the most resource-conservative leaf traits, and spanned the greatest number of phylogenetic lineages but harbored more close relatives within those lineages than other communities. In contrast, unburned communities had the lowest species diversity, the most acquisitive leaf traits, and the fewest phylogenetic lineages, but close relatives co- occurred less frequently. The largest difference in abundance between treatments occurred within the Rosales, Asteraceae, Vitaceae, and the Poaceae; woody Rosales were strongly selected for in unburned communities, while composites and grasses of the Poaceae were strongly selected for under frequent burning. A major climatic perturbation of consecutive hot, dry summers in the late 1980s prompted a significant shift in the functional and phylogenetic composition of communities. Greater than expected turnover in species composition occurred following the drought years, and then again during the subsequent five-year rebound period. Just after the drought year, turnover was greatest among recently diverged taxa, whereas during the rebound period turnover was greater among taxa that diverged deep in the phylogeny. The drought years also caused a short-term shift in functional traits, including declines in specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content and an increase in leaf length. These results indicate that the phylogenetic and functional trait composition of communities are responsive both to fire gradients and to shocks to the system, such as climatic perturbation. Key},

abstract = {The demand for knowledge about the tree of life is steadily rising in ecology and other fields, but bioinformatic resources designed to meet these needs remain poorly developed. Ecologists pursuing phylogenetic insights into the organization of communities have come to rely on relatively conservative reference trees that, in general, are poorly resolved and documented. New methods for inferring very large trees by mining data from DNA sequence repositories will undoubtedly be useful in community phylogenetics but are not without limitations. Here we argue that the collective phylogenetic knowledge embodied in the literature of systematics is a valuable resource that can be tapped in assembling synthetic trees. Assembling a composite ‘‘literature-based'' tree by the judicious grafting of clades is one way to achieve a synthesis of current knowledge, and could, under some circumstances, better represent ‘‘what we know'' about phylogenetic relationships than results obtained from automated pipelines. We describe an approach and new software for storing and annotating trees from published studies and grafting clades together in a documented and repeatable manner. Using this agglomerative approach, we are in the process of assembling a literature- based tree for land plants, which presently contains 14 423 species from over 259 sources. For this strategy to be maximally effective, improvements in digital infrastructure are needed to capture and deploy advances in phylogenetic knowledge as they are published.},

abstract = {While an increasing number of indices for estimating the functional trait diversity of biological communities are being proposed, there is a growing demand by ecologists to clarify their actual implications and simplify index selection. Several key indices relate to mean trait dissimilarity between species within biological communities. Among them, the most widely used include (a) the mean species pairwise dissimilarity (MPD) and (b) the Rao quadratic entropy (and related indices). These indices are often regarded as redundant and promote the unsubstantiated yet widely held view that Rao is a form of MPD. Worryingly, existing R functions also do not always simplify the use and differentiation of these indices. In this paper, we show various distinctions between these two indices that warrant mathematical and biological consideration. We start by showing an existing form of MPD that considers species abundances and is different from Rao both mathematically and conceptually. We then show that the mathematical relationship between MPD and Rao can be presented simply as Rao = MPD {\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} Simpson, where the Simpson diversity index is defined as 1 − dominance. We further show that this relationship is maintained for both species abundances and presence/absence. This evidence dismantles the paradigm that the Rao diversity is an abundance-weighted form of MPD and indicates that both indices can differ substantially at low species diversities. We discuss the different interpretations of trait diversity patterns in biological communities provided by Rao and MPD and then provide a simple R function, called ``melodic,'' which avoids the unintended results that arise from existing mainstream functions.},

abstract = {A basic assumption of the trait-based approach in plant ecology is that differences in functional trait values are greater between species than within species. We ques- tioned this assumption by assessing (1) the relative extent of inter- and intraspecific leaf trait variation throughout a complete growing season (phenological variation) in a group of deciduous and evergreen woody species, and (2) whether species rankings based on leaf traits were main- tained across the growing season. We analysed leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nutrient concentrations (C, N, P), including the C:N and N:P ratios. Intraspecific trait varia- tion (ITV) due to phenology was significantly greater than interspecific variation for leaf N concentration on a mass basis (Nm; 68.90 {\%}) and for the leaf C:N ratio (60.60 {\%}), whereas interspecific variation was significantly higher than ITV for LMA (62.30 {\%}) and for leaf C concentra- tion on a mass (Cm) and area (Ca) basis (Cm 70.40 {\%}; Ca 65.30 {\%}). ITV was particularly low for LMA ({\textless}20 {\%}). Species rankings were highly modified by phenology for a number of leaf traits (Pm, N:P ratio) but were relatively well conserved throughout the growing season for others (LMA, Nm). Patterns of ITV across the growing season dif- fered significantly between deciduous and evergreen spe- cies for all traits except leaf P but did not vary between native and exotic species. Overall, our results show that intraspecific phenological variation in leaf traits may be similar to or greater than interspecific variation and that temporal patterns of ITV vary considerably among traits and species, especially for leaf nutrient concentrations, fac- tors which can potentially affect quantitative interspecific relationships.},

The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the condi- tions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question:How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?},

We compared PD of tree communities growing (1) on substrates of varying geological age; and (2) in environments with varying ecophysiological barriers to growth and survival. Results PDss is strongly positively correlated with species richness (SR), whereas MNTD has a negative correlation. Communities on geologically young- and intermediate-aged substrates (western and central Amazonia respectively) have the highest SR, and therefore the highest PDss and the lowest MNTD. We find that the youngest and oldest substrates (the latter on the Brazilian and Guiana Shields) have the highest ses.PDss and ses.MNTD. MPD and ses.MPD are strongly correlated with how evenly taxa are distributed among the three principal angiosperm clades and are both highest in western Amazonia. Meanwhile, seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) and forests on white sands have low PD, as evaluated by any metric. Main conclusions High ses.PDss and ses.MNTD reflect greater lineage diversity in communities. We suggest that high ses.PDss and ses.MNTD in western Amazonia results from its favourable, easy-to-colonize environment, whereas high values in the Brazilian and Guianan Shields may be due to accumulation of lineages over a longer period of time. White-sand forests and SDTF are dominated by close relatives from fewer lineages, perhaps reflecting ecophysiological barriers that are difficult to surmount evolutionarily. Because MPD and ses.MPD do not reflect lineage diversity per se, we suggest that PDss, ses.PDss and ses.MNTD may be the most useful diversity metrics for setting large-scale conservation priorities.},

In our previous contribution (Haegeman and Loreau 2008), we showed that even a trivial application of EM can yield predictions that provide an excellent fit to empirical data. In his response, Shipley (2009) distinguishes two different versions of the EM procedure, an information-theoretical version and a combinatorial version, to justify a trivial application of EM. Here we first provide a brief user's guide to EM to clarify the various steps involved in the procedure. We then show that the information-theoretical and combinatorial rationales for EM are but complementary views on the same procedure. Lastly, we attempt to identify the conditions that lead to trivial and non-trivial applications of EM. We discuss how non-trivial applications of EM can yield valuable new insights in ecology.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate about the utility of statistical mechanics in predicting diversity patterns in terms of life history traits. Here, I reflect on this debate and show that a community is controlled by the balance of two opposite forces: the entropic part (the natural tendency of the system to be in the configuration with the highest possible entropy) and environmental, ecological and evolutionary constraints maintaining order (reducing entropy). The Boltzmann distribution law that can be derived from the maximum entropy formalism provides a fundamental model for linking species abundance to life history traits and environmental constraining factors. This model predicts a global pattern of diversity evenness along a latitudinal gradient. Although the Boltzmann distribution and the logistic regression models represent two fundamentally different approaches, the two models have an identical mathematical form. Their identical formalisms facilitate the interpretation of logistic regression models with statistical mechanics, and reveal several limitations of the maximum entropy formalism. I argued that although maximum entropy formalism is a promising tool for modeling species abundances and for linking microscopic quantities of individual life history traits to macroscopic patterns of diversity, it is necessary to revise the Boltzmann distribution law for successful prediction of species abundance.},

While many macroecologists have inherited this view, to date they have been much more efficient at producing patterns than identifying their underlying processes. We discuss several possible attitudes for macroecologists to adopt in this context while also arguing that in fact macroecology already has many mechanisms that are ignored. We briefly describe six of these: central limit theorem, fractals, random sampling and placement, neutral theory (and descendents), concordance of forces, and maximum entropy. We explore why these mechanisms are overlooked and discuss whether they should be. We conclude that macroecology needs to take a more pragmatic, less ideological approach to mechanism. We apply this viewpoint to the recent controversy over maximum entropy and suggest that maximum entropy needs to be viewed more pragmatically and less ideologically.},

abstract = {Applying ideas of statistical mechanics in ecology have recently received quite some attention. The entropy maximization (EM) formalism looks particularly attractive, as it provides a simple algorithm to infer detailed system variables from a limited number of constraints. However, we point out that a blind application of this formalism can easily lead to wrong conclusions. To illustrate this, we reanalyze an ecological data set that has been used to claim the good performance of EM in predicting species abundances from trait measurements. We show that these results are entirely due to the restrictive constraints, and do not provide any support for the applicability of EM in ecology. By comparing with a simple example from physics, we indicate which characteristic mechanism of EM, and of statistical mechanics in general, is missing for the ecological example. This analysis introduces a series of methods to evaluate future attempts to apply EM in ecology. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Why does the neutral theory, which is based on unrealistic assumptions, predict diversity patterns so accurately? Answering questions like this requires a radical change in the way we tackle them. The large number of degrees of freedom of ecosystems pose a fundamental obstacle to mechanistic modelling. However, there are tools of statistical physics, such as the maximum entropy formalism (MaxEnt), that allow transcending particular models to simultaneously work with immense families of models with different rules and parameters, sharing only well-established features. We applied MaxEnt allowing species to be ecologically idiosyncratic, instead of constraining them to be equivalent as the neutral theory does. The answer we found is that neutral models are just a subset of the majority of plausible models that lead to the same patterns. Small variations in these patterns naturally lead to the main classical species abundance distributions, which are thus unified in a single framework.},

This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94{\%} of the variance in the relative abundances.},

abstract = {A randomisation test is described for assessing relative abundance predictions from the maximum entropy approach to biodiversity. The null model underlying the test randomly allocates observed abundances to species, but retains key aspects of the structure of the observed communities; site richness, species composition, and trait covariance. Three test statistics are used to explore different characteristics of the predictions. Two are based on pairwise comparisons between observed and predicted species abundances (RMSE, RMSESqrt). The third statistic is novel and is based on community-level abundance patterns, using an index calculated from the observed and predicted community entropies (EDiff). Validation of the test to quantify type I and type II error rates showed no evidence of bias or circularity, confirming the dependencies quantified by Roxburgh and Mokany (2007) and Shipley (2007) have been fully accounted for within the null model. Application of the test to the vineyard data of Shipley et al. (2006) and to an Australian grassland dataset indicated significant departures from the null model, suggesting the integration of species trait information within the maximum entropy framework can successfully predict species abundance patterns. The paper concludes with some general comments on the use of maximum entropy in ecology, including a discussion of the mathematics underlying the Maxent optimisation algorithm and its implementation, the role of absent species in generating biased predictions, and some comments on determining the most appropriate level of data aggregation for Maxent analysis.},

abstract = {The papers in this Forum discussion debate various aspects of my maximum entropy model of community assembly. The questions raised centre around (1) the possible mechanisms generating the patterns predicted by my maxent model of community assembly, and (2) the appropriate statistical methods for testing the patterns. Here I briefly explain the proposed mechanistic basis of the model: natural selection occurring between individuals of different species. If trait differences are linked to differential demographic probabilities (i.e. fitness differences) then natural selection will constrain the average trait values found in the community and such average (‘community-aggregated') traits will then possess information that is translated into the maximum entropy probabilities. If community assembly is strictly neutral then the maxent model will have no predictive ability. This also justifies the null model, and the permutation test, proposed by Roxburgh and Mokany.},

abstract = {Haegeman and Loreau published a paper that is primarily a criticism of a maximum entropy model of trait-based community assembly (by Shipley et al.) and purports to show the limitations of this method in ecology. However, they misunderstood the basic purpose, logic and justification of the maximum entropy formalism and, because of this, leveled criticisms of Shipley et al. that are unfounded. Part of the confusion can be traced to sloppy presentation of the underlying approach in Shipley et al. The confusion arises because maximum entropy models are justified based on information theory and Bayesian logic while the interpretation that Haegeman and Loreau present is based on substantive empirical assumptions about microstate allocations and a combinatorial argument that do not apply to maximum entropy models and which I do not apply to my model in particular.},

abstract = {The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) is a unified theory of biodiversity that predicts a large number of macroecological patterns using only information on the species richness, total abundance, and total metabolic rate of the community. We conducted a strong test of METE, where four of its major predictions were evaluated simultaneously using data from 60 globally distributed communities including over 300,000 individuals and nearly 2000 species. While METE successfully captured 96{\%} and 93{\%} of the variation in the species abundance distribution and the individual size distribution, it performed poorly when characterizing the size-density relationship and the intraspecific distribution of individual body size. Specifically, METE predicts a negative correlation between individual energy use and species abundance, which is weak in natural communities. By evaluating multiple predictions with large quantities of data, our study not only identifies a mismatch between abundance and body size in METE, but also serves as a general example on the importance of conducting strong tests of ecological theories.},

abstract = {Community ecologists seek to understand the processes acting on community assembly and the importance of species ecological differences to the co- existence of organisms. Here we investigated trait distribution patterns in two contrasting vegetation types, how the inclusion of intraspecific variability improves our ability to understand trait-based assem- bly, and if soil features predict the occurrence of non- random trait distribution patterns. We conducted our study at Emas National Park, Goia ´s, Brazil. We used a null model approach to investigate trait distribution patterns and a model selection approach to quantify soil features important in structuring assemblages. In savanna, we detected trait convergence at individual and species level (evidence of environmental filters) favoring plants with resource conservation strategies. In forests, however, trait dispersion at individual level equal to a random expectation corroborated a premise of neutral theory (individuals ecological equivalence). Nevertheless, at species level, we found convergence (seed mass) and divergence (height), reflecting distinct strategies related to light capture and resource use. Therefore, including intraspecific trait variability did not improve the detection of non-random trait distri- bution patterns. Furthermore, the influence of soil features on trait patterns was different between savanna and forest. There was a tendency for niche differentiation toward more fertile and clayey soils, but the relative importance of soil factors in assem- bling communities could not be generalized for savannas and dry forests.},

abstract = {Correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) estimate species niches using occurrence records and environmental data. These tools are valuable to the field of biogeography, where they are commonly used to infer potential connectivity among populations. However, a recent study showed that when locally relevant environmental data are not available, records from patches of suitable habitat protruding into otherwise unsuitable regions (e.g., gallery forests within dry areas) can lead to overestimations of species niches and their potential distribu- tions. Here, we test whether this issue obfuscates detection of an obvious envi- ronmental barrier existing in northern Venezuela – that of the hot and xeric lowlands separating the Pen? ınsula de Paraguan? a from mainland South America. These conditions most likely promote isolation between mainland and peninsu- lar populations of three rodent lineages occurring in mesic habitat in this region. For each lineage, we calibrated optimally parameterized ENMs using mainland records only, and leveraged existing habitat descriptions to assess whether those assigned low suitability values corresponded to instances where the species was collected within locally mesic conditions amidst otherwise hot dry areas. When this was the case, we built an additional model excluding these records. We projected both models onto the peninsula and assessed whether they differed in their ability to detect the environmental barrier. For the two lineages in which we detected such problematic records, only the models built excluding them detected the barrier, while providing additional insights regard- ing peninsular populations. Overall, the study reveals how a simple procedure like the one applied here can deal with records problematic for ENMs, leading to better predictions regarding the potential effects of the environment on lineage},

@article{Powers2004,
abstract = { Emergent tree species do not appear to influence local soil chemistry (4 tested). This study may have had low power to detect differences, but there are several plausible biological explanations for absence of 'stat. significant'  results:  (note that equivalence of leaf/ litter chemistry is not a plausible explanation, since measured differences are often large) Other life-forms beneath emergent canopies may overwhelm any individual tree differences.   For example:   Lianas may serve to redistribute nutrients within tropical forests, because their canopies may be horizontally distant from the root zone (Putz 1984). Thus, nutrients that are acquired by roots in one patch of soil may be translocated tens of metres away through the stem, and later delivered to a distant patch of forest floor via litter fall.   Secondly, animal activity: diverse animals (e.g. termites, ants, anteaters, coatis, armadillos) may homogenize soil by digging or burrowing.  ABSTRACT: Although a number of studies have demonstrated that tree species modify soil environments in temperate forests or monospecific tree plantations in the tropics (Fisher 1995, Rhoades 1997), few studies have investigated these processes in species-rich tropical forests (but see Rhoades et al. 1994). We investigated whether soil chemistry (total soil C, N, pH and extractable nutrients [Ca, Mg, K, P]) differs underneath the crowns of emergent rain-forest tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.  Studied four species from different families: Hyeronima alchorneoides Allem˜ao (Euphorbiaceae) and  Lecythis ampla Miers (Lecythidaceae), and two legumes Dipteryx panamensis (Pittier) Record {\&} Mell (Fabaceae), Balizia elegans Ducke (Mimosaceae).  Soil chemical properties are known to vary over the 1500-ha reserve as a function of topography, parent material and soil age (Sollins et al. 1994), and tree species are  distributed differentially over these gradients (Clark et al. 1998).   In order to separate the effects of individual species from large-scale gradients in nutrient availability, we paired every sampled tree with the nearest Pentaclethra macroloba (Willd.) Kuntze (Mimosaceae) tree. Pentaclethra is the dominant tree species at La Selva, accounting for 36–38{\%} of estimated aboveground biomass (Clark{\&}Clark 2000a). Thus, we considered soil chemistry  under the crowns of adjacent mature Pentaclethra trees as the ‘background' local soil conditions and estimated species' effects on soil chemistry by difference between each focal tree and its Pentaclethra neighbour.  Focal trees ({\textgreater}70 cm diameter breast height) and adjacent Pentaclethras ({\textless}40m distant, {\textgreater}50cm dbh)  The large differences in soil chemistry among the four species reflect the biased distributions of individual species toward different soil types (Table 1) (Clark et al. 1998).  For example, the Hyeronima trees were consistently located on more nutrient-rich alluvial soils.  Our data suggest that if these four emergent tree species have direct effects on soil  chemical properties, then those effects are small and many more samples than we collected may be needed to detect them (based on power analysis).  Equivalent litter chemistry of the species is not a likely explanation for our results, given observed diffs in N concn. A second potential mechanism is the presence of plants with different life forms that grow interspersed with and underneath the crowns of emergent trees. Foliar N and P contents vary with life form and stature (Bigelow 1993), and thus the presence of other plants may disrupt any localized effects of emergent trees on soil properties (Boettcher {\&} Kalisz 1990).  In particular, liana leaves are estimated to comprise 15{\%} of the total foliage in La Selva primary forest (Werner 1985 cited in Clark 1994), and may have a special role in homogenizing patterns of soil properties.  Lianas may serve to redistribute nutrients within tropical forests, because their canopies may be horizontally distant from the root zone (Putz 1984). Thus, nutrients that are acquired by roots in one patch of soil may be translocated tens of metres away through the stem, and later delivered to a distant patch of forest floor via litter fall.   Finally, animal activity in these tropical forests may be much greater than in temperate forests. A diverse group of animals including termites, ants, anteaters, coatis and armadillos live in this forest andmay homogenize soil by digging or burrowing.   In summary, we conclude that although emergent tree species may affect soil chemistry and nutrient availability in this wet tropical forest, these effects cannot be generalized to all tree species and were undetectable in the four emergent tree species that we studied.},

abstract = {* One of the primary goals in community ecology is to determine the relative importance of processes and mechanisms that control biodiversity. Here, we examined habitat-driven species assemblages and species distribution patterns as well as their temporal variations for three life stages of two censuses of a 25-ha mixed dipterocarp forest at Sinharaja (Sri Lanka). * Our general objective was to find out whether the species assemblages and associated habitat types changed with life stage, spatial scale and species attributes. We also analyse whether the habitat types were related to certain indicator species. Habitat types were determined with multivariate regression tree analyses driven by topographic variables. * We found species assemblages associated with five distinct habitat types that appeared consistently for all life stages of the two censuses. These habitats were related to ridge-valley gradients and a pronounced contrast in south-west versus north-east aspect. Habitat-driven structuring was weak at the recruit stage but strong in the juvenile and adult stages. The species assemblage variance explained by topographic variables for different life stages ranged between 10{\%} for recruits and 23{\%} for juveniles. * The species assemblages determined for different spatial scales (10, 20, 50 m) showed similar habitat partitioning, but the variance explained by the topographic variables increased in all life stages with spatial scale. This could be due to the homogenizing effect of topographic variables at the larger scales and unaccounted environmental variation at the smaller scales. The number of indicator species identified in the two censuses was higher in the juvenile stage than in the adult stage, and nearly all indicator species in the adult stage were also indicator species in the juvenile stage. * Synthesis. Our study showed that approximately 75{\%} of the variance in local species composition is unexplained. This may be due to spatially structured processes such as dispersal limitation, unaccounted biotic and abiotic environmental variables, and stochastic effects, but only 25{\%} were due to topographic habitat association. Although the pronounced ridge-valley gradient and contrast of south-west versus north-east aspect created consistent habitats, our results suggest that local species assemblages at Sinharaja forest are jointly shaped by neutral and niche processes.},

abstract = {A persistent challenge in ecology is to explain the high diversity of tree species in tropical forests. Although the role of species characteristics in maintaining tree diversity in tropical forests has been the subject of theory and debate for decades, spatial patterns in local diversity have not been analyzed from the viewpoint of individual species. To measure scale-dependent local diversity structures around individual species, we propose individual species-area relationships (ISAR), a spatial statistic that marries common species-area relationships with Ripley's K to measure the expected alpha diversity in circular neighborhoods with variable radius around an arbitrary individual of a target species. We use ISAR to investigate if and at which spatial scales individual species increase in tropical forests' local diversity (accumulators), decrease local diversity (repellers), or behave neutrally. Our analyses of data from Barro Colorado Island (Panama) and Sinharaja (Sri Lanka) reveal that individual species leave identifiable signatures on spatial diversity, but only on small spatial scales. Most species showed neutral behavior outside neighborhoods of 20 m. At short scales ({\textless}20 m), we observed, depending on the forest type, two strongly different roles of species: diversity repellers dominated at Barro Colorado Island and accumulators at Sinharaja. Nevertheless, we find that the two tropical forests lacked any key species structuring species diversity at larger scales, suggesting that "balanced" species-species interactions may be a characteristic of these species-rich forests. We anticipate our analysis method will be a starting point for more powerful investigations of spatial structures in diversity to promote a better understanding of biodiversity in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

abstract = {We present PhyloMeasures, a new software package including both a C++ and R version, that provides very fast computation of popular phylogenetic diversity measures. PhyloMeasures introduces two major advances over existing methods. First, it uses efficient algorithms for calculating basic phylogenetic metrics (such as Faith's PD and the mean pairwise distance, MPD) and two-sample measures (such as common branch length, CBL, and the unique fraction) that are designed to perform well even on very large trees. Second, it computes exact richness-standardised versions of these measures (such as the widely used net relatedness index, NRI) by efficiently evaluating analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the basic measures, rather than by the slow and inexact randomization techniques that are the current standard. Together, these lead to massive improvements in performance compared to the current state of the art. For example, running on a standard laptop, PhyloMeasures functions can provide the NRI for 20 samples from a tree of 100,000 tips in about 1.5 seconds, compared to an estimated 37 days using standard resampling approaches. This will allow analyses on larger data sets than were previously possible.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence-absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

abstract = {1. Spatial variation in filters imposed by the abiotic environment causes variation in functional traits within and among plant species. This is abundantly clear for plant species along eleva- tional gradients, where parallel abiotic selection pressures give rise to predictable variation in leaf phenotypes among ecosystems. Understanding the factors responsible for such patterns may provide insight into the current and future drivers of biodiversity, local community structure and ecosystem function. 2. In order to explore patterns in trait variation along elevational gradients, we conducted a meta-analysis of published observational studies that measured three key leaf functional traits that are associated with axes of variation in both resource competition and stress tolerance: leaf mass:area ratio (LMA), leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) and N content per unit area (Narea). To examine whether there may be evidence for a genetic basis underlying the trait variation, we conducted a review of published results from common garden experiments that measured the same leaf traits. 3. Within studies, LMA and Narea tended to decrease with mean annual temperature (MAT) along elevational gradients, while Nmass did not vary systematically with MAT. Correlations among pairs of traits varied significantly with MAT: LMA was most strongly correlated with Nmass and Narea at high-elevation sites with relatively lower MAT. The strengths of the rela- tionships were equal or greater within species relative to the relationships among species, sug- gesting parallel evolutionary dynamics along elevational gradients among disparate biomes. Evidence from common garden studies further suggests that there is an underlying genetic basis to the functional trait variation that we documented along elevational gradients. 4. Taken together, these results indicate that environmental filtering both selects locally adapted genotypes within plant species and constrains species to elevational ranges based on their ranges of potential leaf trait values. If individual phenotypes are filtered from populations in the same way that species are filtered from regional species pools, changing climate may affect both the species and functional trait composition of plant communities.},

abstract = {The metacommunity concept, describing how local and regional scale processes interact to structure communities, has been successfully applied to patterns of taxonomic diversity. Functional diversity has proved useful for understanding local scale processes, but has less often been applied to understanding regional scale processes. Here, we explore functional diversity patterns within a metacommunity context to help elucidate how local and regional scale processes influence community assembly. We detail how each of the four metacommunity perspectives (species sorting, mass effects, patch dynamics, neutral) predict different patterns of functional beta- and alpha-diversity and spatial structure along two key gradients: dispersal limitation and environmental conditions. We then apply this conceptual model to a case study from alpine tundra plant communities. We sampled species composition in 17 ‘sky islands' of alpine tundra in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA that differed in geographic isolation and area (key factors related to dispersal limitation) and temperature and elevation (key environmental factors). We quantified functional diversity in each site based on specific leaf area, leaf area, stomatal conductance, plant height and chlorophyll content. We found that colder high elevation sites were functionally more similar to each other (decreased functional beta-diversity) and had lower functional alpha-diversity. Geographic isolation and area did not influence functional beta- or alpha-diversity. These results suggest a strong role for environmental conditions structuring alpine plant communities, patterns consistent with the species sorting metacommunity perspective. Incorporating functional diversity into metacommunity theory can help elucidate how local and regional factors structure communities and provide a framework for observationally examining the role of metacommunity dynamics in systems where experimental approaches are less tractable.},

abstract = {1.Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is hypothesized to play an important role in community assembly and the maintenance of biodiversity. However, fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how ITV contributes to mechanisms that create spatial variation in the functional-trait composition of communities (functional $\beta$-diversity). Importantly, ITV may influence the perceived importance of environmental filtering across spatial scales. 2.We examined how ITV contributes to functional $\beta$-diversity and environmental filtering in woody plant communities in a temperate forest in the Ozark ecoregion, Missouri, USA. To test the hypothesis that ITV contributes to changes in the perceived importance of environmental filtering across scales, we compared patterns of functional $\beta$-diversity across soil-resource and topographic gradients at three spatial grains and three spatial extents. To quantify the contribution of ITV to functional $\beta$-diversity, we compared patterns that included ITV in five traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf water content, leaf toughness, and chlorophyll content) to patterns based on species-mean trait values. 3.Functional $\beta$-diversity that included ITV increased with spatial extent and decreased with spatial grain, suggesting stronger environmental filtering within spatially extensive landscapes that contain populations locally adapted to different habitats. In contrast, functional $\beta$-diversity based on species-mean trait values increased with spatial extent but did not change with spatial grain, suggesting weaker environmental filtering among larger communities which each contain a variety of habitats and locally adapted populations. 4.Synthesis. Although studies typically infer community assembly mechanisms from species-mean trait values, our study suggests that mean trait values may mask the strength of assembly mechanisms such as environmental filtering, especially in landscape-scale studies that encompass strong environmental gradients and locally adapted populations. Our study highlights the utility of integrating ITV into studies of functional $\beta$-diversity to better understand the ecological conditions under which trait variation within and among species contributes most strongly to patterns of biodiversity across spatial scales.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation is hypothesized to influence the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. However, few studies have explicitly considered how intraspecific trait variation among ontogenetic stages influences community assembly across environmental gradients. Because the relative importance of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms can differ among ontogenetic stages within and across environments, ontogenetic trait variation may have an important influence on patterns of functional diversity and inferred assembly mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that variation in functional diversity across a topo-edaphic gradient differs among ontogenetic stages and that these patterns reflect a shift in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms. In a temperate forest in the Missouri Ozarks, USA, we compared functional diversity of leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) of 34 woody plant species at two ontogenetic stages (adults and saplings) to test predictions about how the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering changes among adult and sapling communities. Local communities of adults had lower mean SLA and lower functional dispersion of SLA than expected by chance, particularly at the resource-limited end of the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for abiotic filtering among co-occurring adults. In contrast, local communities of saplings often had higher functional dispersion of leaf size and SLA than expected by chance regardless of their location along the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for biotic filtering among co-occurring saplings. Moreover, the overall strength of trait-environment relationships varied between saplings and adults for both leaf traits, generally resulting in stronger environmental shifts in mean trait values and trait dispersion for adults relative to saplings. Our results illustrate how community assembly mechanisms may shift in their relative importance during ontogeny, leading to variable patterns of functional diversity across environmental gradients. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of integrating ontogeny, an important axis of intraspecific trait variability, into approaches that use plant functional traits to understand community assembly and species coexistence.},

abstract = {Environmental filtering and niche differentiation are processes proposed to drive community assembly, generating nonrandom patterns in community trait distributions. Despite the substantial intraspecific trait variation present in plant communities, most previous studies of trait-based community assembly have used species mean trait values and therefore not accounted for intraspecific variation. Using a null model approach, I tested for environmental filtering and niche differentiation acting on three key functional traits--vegetative height, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC)-in old-field plant communities. I also examined how accounting for intraspecific variation at the among-plot and individual levels affected the detection of nonrandom assembly patterns. Tests using fixed species mean trait values provided evidence of environmental filtering acting on height and SLA and niche differentiation acting on SLA. Including plot-level intraspecific variation increased the strength of these patterns, indicating an important role of intraspecific variation in community assembly. Tests using individual trait data indicated strong environmental filtering acting on all traits, but provided no evidence of niche differentiation, although these signals may have been obscured by the effects of dispersal limitation and spatial aggregation of conspecific individuals. There was also strong evidence of nonrandom assembly of individuals within single species, with the strength of environmental filtering varying among species. This study demonstrates that, while analyses using fixed species mean trait values can provide insights into community assembly processes, accounting for intraspecific variation provides a more complete view of communities and the processes driving their assembly.},

abstract = {Summary: A key issue in plant/herbivore interaction research is to understand which plant traits drive differences in herbivore damage. Variation in chemical, physical or phenological traits of plants may all modulate the degree of herbivore damage among species and individuals, yet the relative importance of these factors is still subject to debate, particularly in species-rich systems such as tropical rain forests. To address this issue, we quantified leaf herbivore damage in 28 common tree species of the Yasun{\'{i}} forest dynamic plot (YFDP) in the Ecuadorian Amazon over 11 months. Census data from the YFDP allowed us to quantify several aspects of tree ecology potentially affecting herbivory including leaf turnover and spatial distribution patterns. We measured six chemical, eight physical and four ecological traits of the focal species. Using a combination of multivariate analyses and phylogenetic generalized linear regression model (PGLS), we assessed trade-offs between physical and chemical traits and the relative effect of all these traits on leaf herbivore damage. Herbivore damage was highly variable among species and individuals, with leaves on average displaying damage over 13.4{\%} (2.5-29.5{\%}) of their area. We found no significant trade-off between physical and chemical defences for the 28 studied tree species. Overall, leaf size, shearing resistance, cellulose, ash content and leaf size × ash were the best predictors of herbivore damage. Surprisingly, condensed tannins and latex did not significantly correlate with herbivore damage. In addition, we found no relationships between herbivory and local tree density. However, we did find a weak effect of tree clustering and strong effect of tree leaf turnover rates on herbivore damage. Synthesis. In the western Amazon, leaves are defended against herbivores through a combination of physical (toughness), chemical (toughness-related elements), and phenological (rapid leaf replacement) characteristics that do not appear to be subject to obvious trade-offs. Conventional strategies, such as condensed tannins or latex, do not seem to be strongly involved as a defence against herbivores in this community.

However, the importance of ITV varies greatly among studies, and we lack a coherent understanding of the contexts under which to expect a high versus low contribution of ITV to trait-environment matching among communities. Here we first elaborate a novel conceptual framework posing specific hypotheses and predictions about the environmental and ecological contexts underlying the contribution of ITV to community trait turnover. We then empirically test these predictions in understory herbaceous plant communities in a montane environment, for 3 functional traits (flowering phenology, specific leaf area and height). We found that different components of trait variation mapped onto different environmental axes, specifically reporting a greater contribution of ITV along non-climatic axes (e.g., soil properties, light) than along the main climatic axis (i.e., ele...},

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of ∼130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.},

abstract = {Functional traits are often used as species-specific mean trait values in comparative plant ecology or trait-based predictions of ecosystem processes, assuming that interspecific differences are greater than intraspecific trait variation and that trait-based ranking of species is consistent across environments. Although this assumption is increasingly challenged, there is a lack of knowledge regarding to what degree the extent of intraspecific trait variation in response to varying environmental conditions depends on the considered traits and the characteristics of the studied species to evaluate the consequences for trait-based species ranking. We studied functional traits of eight perennial grassland species classified into different functional groups (forbs vs. grasses) and varying in their inherent growth stature (tall vs. small) in a common garden experiment with different environments crossing three levels of nutrient availability and three levels of light availability over 4 months of treatment applications. Grasses and forbs differed in almost all above- and belowground traits, while trait differences related to growth stature were generally small. The traits showing the strongest responses to resource availability were similarly for grasses and forbs those associated with allocation and resource uptake. The strength of trait variation in response to varying resource availability differed among functional groups (grasses {\textgreater} forbs) and species of varying growth stature (small-statured {\textgreater} tall-statured species) in many aboveground traits, but only to a lower extent in belowground traits. These differential responses altered trait-based species ranking in many aboveground traits, such as specific leaf area, tissue nitrogen and carbon concentrations and above-belowground allocation (leaf area ratio and root : shoot ratio) at varying resource supply, while trait-based species ranking was more consistent in belowground traits. Our study shows that species grouping according to functional traits is valid, but trait-based species ranking depends on environmental conditions, thus limiting the applicability of species-specific mean trait values in ecological studies.},

In contrast to most current statistical approaches that rely on community metrics and randomization tests, PGLMMs are model-based statistics that fit observed presence/absence data to underlying hypotheses about the distributions of species among communities.

abstract = {The relative degree to which stochastic and deterministic processes underpin community assembly is a central problem in ecology. Quantifying local-scale phylogenetic and functional beta diversity may shed new light on this problem. We used species distribution, soil, trait and phylogenetic data to quantify whether environmental distance, geographic distance or their combination are the strongest predictors of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity on local scales in a 20-ha tropical seasonal rainforest dynamics plot in southwest China. The patterns of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity were generally consistent. The phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity between subplots (10 × 10 m, 20 × 20 m, 50 × 50 m and 100 × 100 m) was often higher than that expected by chance. The turnover of lineages and species function within habitats was generally slower than that across habitats. Partitioning the variation in phylogenetic and functional beta diversity showed that environmental distance was generally a better predictor of beta diversity than geographic distance thereby lending relatively more support for deterministic environmental filtering over stochastic processes. Overall, our results highlight that deterministic processes play a stronger role than stochastic processes in structuring community composition in this diverse assemblage of tropical trees.},

abstract = {1. Statistical modelling is often used to relate sparse biological survey data to remotely derived environmental predictors, thereby providing a basis for predictively mapping biodiversity across an entire region of interest. The most popular strategy for such modelling has been to model distributions of individual species one at a time. Spatial modelling of biodiversity at the community level may, however, confer significant benefits for applications involving very large numbers of species, particularly if many of these species are recorded infrequently. 2. Community-level modelling combines data from multiple species and produces information on spatial pattern in the distribution of biodiversity at a collective community level instead of, or in addition to, the level of individual species. Spatial outputs from community-level modelling include predictive mapping of community types (groups of locations with similar species composition), species groups (groups of species with similar distributions), axes or gradients of compositional variation, levels of compositional dissimilarity between pairs of locations, and various macro-ecological properties (e.g. species richness). 3. Three broad modelling strategies can be used to generate these outputs: (i) 'assemble first, predict later', in which biological survey data are first classified, ordinated or aggregated to produce community-level entities or attributes that are then modelled in relation to environmental predictors; (ii) 'predict first, assemble later', in which individual species are modelled one at a time as a function of environmental variables, to produce a stack of species distribution maps that is then subjected to classification, ordination or aggregation; and (iii) 'assemble and predict together', in which all species are modelled simultaneously, within a single integrated modelling process. These strategies each have particular strengths and weaknesses, depending on the intended purpose of modelling and the type, quality and quantity of data involved. 4. Synthesis and applications. The potential benefits of modelling large multispecies data sets using community-level, as opposed to species-level, approaches include faster processing, increased power to detect shared patterns of environmental response across rarely recorded species, and enhanced capacity to synthesize complex data into a form more readily interpretable by scientists and decision-makers. Community-level modelling therefore deserves to be considered more often, and more widely, as a potential alternative or supplement to modelling individual species. Key-words:},

abstract = {1.The management of both desirable and undesirable species requires an understanding of the factors determining their distribution. Quantitative distribution models offer simple methods for formulating the species–habitat link and the means not only for predicting where species should occur, but also for understanding the factors involved. Generalized linear modelling, in particular, links the incidence of species to habitat variables, and has increasingly formed the backbone of the modelling approaches used. New ‘data technologies', such as remote sensing and geographical information systems, have further broadened these modelling applications to almost any ecological system and any species for which there are distribution data. 2.Many previous approaches have aimed to identify the most parsimonious model with the best suite of predictors, selected on the basis of null hypothesis testing. However,information-theoretic approaches based on Akaike's information criterion allow the selection of a best approximating model or a subset of models from a set of candidates. Information-theoretic approaches require a deeper understanding of the biology of the system modelled and may well become an improved paradigm for species distribution modelling. 3.Synthesis and applications. This special profile of six papers demonstrates the development in methodology used in species distribution modelling. The papers show how information-theoretic approaches can be coupled with emerging data technologies to address issues of conservation significance. With conservation biology and applied ecology at the forefront of many of the basic science developments so far, we expect these methods to pervade other areas of ecological research more fully in future.},

SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and ma- rine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both dif- ferences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hin- dering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {The niche is one of the most important concepts in ecology. However, there has been a persistent controversy on how to define, measure, and predict the ecological niche of an organism. Here I argue that these problems arise in part because the niche is defined by the set of all possible environments, many of which do not exist in nature. A complete description of the niche would require knowledge of a large number of environments that do not exist in nature. Given this, I propose that ecologists should not focus on the niche itself but instead on determining if a particular environment is a part of the niche. I then demonstrate that such an analysis has a natural interpretation as an estimate of the probability that an environment is suitable and that either experimental investigations or analyses of presence data can estimate this quantity. Depending on the way that resources interact to shape environmental requirements, the probability that an environment is a part of the niche behaves like published descriptions of causal inferences and distribution models. However, in some cases the probability that an environment is suitable can be strongly influenced by unmeasured aspects of the environment. When this is true, experimental and distribution models have complimentary strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract = {1. Developing the next-generation of species distribution modelling (SDM) requires solutions to a number of widely recognised problems. Here, we address the problem of uncertainty in predictor variables arising from fine-scale environmental variation. 2. We explain how this uncertainty may cause scale-dependent ‘regression dilution', elsewhere a well-understood statistical issue, and explain its consequences for SDM. We then demonstrate a simple, general correction for regression dilution based on Bayesian methods using latent variables. With this correction in place, unbiased estimates of species occupancy vs. the true environment can be retrieved from data on occupancy vs. measured environment, where measured environment is correlated with the true environment, but subject to substantial measurement error. 3. We then show how applying our correction to multiple co-occurring species simultaneously increases the accuracy of parameter estimates for each species, as well as estimates for the true environment at each survey plot – a phenomenon we call ‘neighbourly advice'. With a sufficient number of species, the estimates of the true environment at each plot can become extremely accurate. 4. Our correction for regression dilution could be integrated with models addressing other issues in SDM, e.g. biotic interactions and/or spatial dynamics. We suggest that Bayesian analysis, as employed here to address uncertainty in predictor variables, might offer a flexible toolbox for developing such next-generation species distribution models.},

abstract = {We used classification tree analysis to develop a climate-based distribution model for Fagus crenata forests in Japan. Four climatic variables judged likely to affect the distribution of the species (summer and winter precipitation, minimum temperature of the coldest month and Kira's warmth index) were chosen as independent variables for the model. Latitudinal and longitudinal information was also used to examine effects of spatial autocorrelation on the model. The climatic factors associated with the distribution of the forests were analysed using a classification tree to devise prediction rules. Predicted areas of high probability for forest occurrence lay mainly on the Sea of Japan side of northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido. This is consistent with actual forest distribution. Some areas with high predicted probabilities of F. crenata forest occurrence were beyond the current natural northern range limits of these forests. Since these areas were widely scattered, it was assumed that the species has been hindered from colonizing them due to dispersal limitations. Deviance-weighted scores, used to compare magnitudes of the contributions of predictor variables, revealed winter precipitation as the most influential factor, followed by the warmth index. the minimum temperature of the coldest month and summer precipitation. Attempts were made to generate ecological explanations for the effects of the four climatic factors on the distribution of F. crenata forests},

abstract = {Dispersal-assembly theories of species coexistence posit that environmental factors play no role in explaining community diversity and structure. Dispersal-assembly theories shed light on some aspects of community structure such as species-area and species-abundance relationships. However, species' environmental associations also affect these measures of community structure. Measurements of species' niche breadth and overlap address this influence. Using a new continuous measure of niche and a dispersal-assembly null model that maintains species' niche breadth and aggregation, we tested two hypotheses assessing the effects of habitat heterogeneity on the ability of dispersal-assembly theories to explain community niche structure. We found that in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments dispersal-assembly theories cannot fully explain observed niche structure. The performance of the dispersal-assembly null models was particularly poor in heterogeneous environments. These results indicate that non-dispersal based mechanisms are in part responsible for observed community structure and measures of community structure which include species' environmental associations should be used to test theories of species diversity.},

abstract = {The integration of ecology and evolutionary biology requires an understanding of the evolutionary lability in species' ecological niches. For tropical trees, specialization for particular soil resource and topographic conditions is an important part of the habitat niche, influencing the distributions of individual species and overall tree community structure at the local scale. However, little is known about how these habitat niches are related to the evolutionary history of species. We assessed the relationship between taxonomic rank and tree species' soil resource and topographic niches in eight large (24-50 ha) tropical forest dynamics plots. Niche overlap values, indicating the similarity of two species' distributions along soil or topographic axes, were calculated for all pairwise combinations of co-occurring tree species at each study site. Congeneric species pairs often showed greater niche overlap (i.e., more similar niches) than non-congeneric pairs along both soil and topographic axes, though significant effects were found for only five sites based on Mantel tests. No evidence for taxonomic effects was found at the family level. Our results indicate that local habitat niches of trees exhibit varying degrees of phylogenetic signal at different sites, which may have important ramifications for the phylogenetic structure of these communities.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Competition theory predicts that community structure may be shaped by resource partitioning between co-occurring species. As such, quantifying the degree of resource partitioning (i.e., niche overlap) is a key component of studies examining community structure and species coexistence. 2. For many organisms, multiple resource axes quantify niche space. Each axis may be described by a different type of data (e.g. categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores), with different data types requiring different statistical treatments. Therefore, incorporating multiple axes into a single measure of niche space is problematic. 3. Here, we propose general methods for combining multiple niche axes, each characterized by different data types, within a unified analysis of niche overlap. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, we show that each data type can give rise to directly comparable measures of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species. 4. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single unified analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes. 5. We then describe null model permutation tests that assess statistical differences in niche overlap, which can address questions commonly posed by population ecologists (e.g. do two species occupy different niche space?) and community ecologists (e.g. are multiple species evenly distributed across niche space?). 6. To illustrate the use of these newly devised indices, we use an example from reef fishes that combines ratio, categorical and electivity data, and an example from alpine plants that combines continuous and ratio data. 7. The methods described in this article are relevant to a wide variety of ecological projects, including the investigation of invasive species, relative abundance distributions, global change, species coexistence and evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {Tropical tree communities are shaped by local-scale habitat heterogeneity in the form of topographic and edaphic variation, but the life-history stage at which habitat associations develop remains poorly understood. This is due, in part, to the fact that previous studies have not accounted for the widely disparate sample sizes (number of stems) that result when trees are divided into size classes. We demonstrate that the observed habitat structuring of a community is directly related to the number of individuals in the community. We then compare the relative importance of habitat heterogeneity to tree community structure for saplings, juveniles and adult trees within seven large (24-50 ha) tropical forest dynamics plots while controlling for sample size. Changes in habitat structuring through tree life stages were small and inconsistent among life stages and study sites. Where found, these differences were an order of magnitude smaller than the findings of previous studies that did not control for sample size. Moreover, community structure and composition were very similar among tree sub-communities of different life stages. We conclude that the structure of these tropical tree communities is established by the time trees are large enough to be included in the census (1 cm diameter at breast height), which indicates that habitat filtering occurs during earlier life stages.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has received considerable attention in the last two decades, and is now widely recognized. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field. 2. We review the development of plant facilitation research, focusing on the history of the field, the relationship between plant-plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for facilitation research. 3. With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and implementation of experiments that move beyond the clear limitations of previous studies. 4. There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future studies should connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of species coexistence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies with environmental severity. 5. Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental processes. 6. Evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms. 7. Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for the development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our understanding of the response of plant species and communities to environmental change drivers. 8. Attempts to apply our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant-plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and global change ecology. 9. Synthesis: Plant facilitation research provides new insights into classic ecological theory and pressing environmental issues. Awareness and understanding of facilitation should be part of the basic ecological knowledge of all plant ecologists.},

abstract = {We examined fine-scale heterogeneity of environmental conditions in a primary rain forest in French Guiana to describe variation in microhabitats that plants may experience during establishment. We characterized both the range as well as the spatial structuring of 11 environmental factors important for seedling establishment in six hexagonal sampling grids, one each in gap and understory sites at three points representing the predominant geomorphic units in this primary forest. Each grid contained 37 sampling points separated by 31 cm-20 m. Monte-Carlo tests of semivariograms against complete spatial randomness indicated that for many variables in all six sampling grids, spatial dependence did not exceed 1 m. A principal component analysis of all sampling points revealed a lack of spatial microhabitat structure, rather than homogeneous patches associated with canopy structure or geomorphology. Our results suggest that ample fine-scale spatial heterogeneity exists to support the coexistence of plant species with differential abiotic requirements for regeneration.},

@article{Shipley2012,
abstract = {Although niche-based and stochastic processes, including dispersal limitation and demographic stochasticity, can each contribute to community assembly, it is difficult to quantify the relative importance of each process in natural vegetation. Here, we extend Shipley's maxent model (Community Assembly by Trait Selection, CATS) for the prediction of relative abundances to incorporate both trait-based filtering and dispersal limitation from the larger landscape and develop a statistical decomposition of the proportions of the total information content of relative abundances in local communities that are attributable to trait-based filtering, dispersal limitation, and demographic stochasticity. We apply the method to tree communities in a mature, species-rich, tropical forest in French Guiana at 1-, 0.25- and 0.04-ha scales. Trait data consisted of species' means of 17 functional traits measured over both the entire meta-community and separately in each of nine 1-ha plots. Trait means calculated separately for each site always gave better predictions. There was clear evidence of trait-based filtering at all spatial scales. Trait-based filtering was the most important process at the 1-ha scale (34{\%}), whereas demographic stochasticity was the most important at smaller scales (37–53{\%}). Dispersal limitation from the meta-community was less important and approximately constant across scales (9{\%}), and there was also an unresolved association between site-specific traits and meta-community relative abundances. Our method allows one to quantify the relative importance of local niche-based and meta-community processes and demographic stochasticity during community assembly across spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Niche and neutral theories emphasize different processes that contribute to the maintenance of species diversity and should leave different spatial structures in species assemblages. In this study we used variation partitioning in combination with distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps and habitat variables to determine the relative importance of the effects of pure habitat, pure spatial, and spatially structured habitat processes on the spatial distribution of tree species composition and richness in a 25-ha tropical rain forest of Sinharaja/Sri Lanka. We analyzed the contribution of those components at three spatial scales (10 m, 20 m, and 50 m) for all trees and the three life stages: recruits, juveniles, and adults. At the 10-m scale, 80{\%} of the variation in species composition remained unexplained for recruits and adults, but only 55{\%} for juveniles. With increasingly broader scales these figures were strongly reduced, mainly by an increasing contribution of the spatially structured habitat component, which explained 4-30{\%}, 20-47{\%}, and 8-35{\%} of variation in species composition for recruits, juveniles, and adults, respectively. The pure spatial component was most important at the 20-m scale and reached 20{\%}, 32{\%}, and 23{\%} for recruits, juveniles, and adults, respectively. The spatially structured habitat component described variability at broader scales than the pure spatial component. Our results suggest that stochastic processes and spatially structuring processes of community dynamics, such as dispersal limitation and habitat association, contributed jointly to explain species composition and richness at the Sinharaja forest, but their relative importance changed with scale and life stage. Species assembly at the local scale was more strongly impacted by stochasticity, whereas the signal of habitat was stronger at the 50-m scale where plant-scale stochasticity is averaged out. Recent research points to an emerging consensus on the relative contribution of stochasticity, habitat, and spatial processes in governing community assembly, but how these components change with life stage, and how this is influenced by sample size, remains to be explored.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPREMISE OF THE STUDY: It has been 8 years since the last comprehensive analysis of divergence times across the angiosperms. Given recent methodological improvements in estimating divergence times, refined understanding of relationships among major angiosperm lineages, and the immense interest in using large angiosperm phylogenies to investigate questions in ecology and comparative biology, new estimates of the ages of the major clades are badly needed. Improved estimations of divergence times will concomitantly improve our understanding of both the evolutionary history of the angiosperms and the patterns and processes that have led to this highly diverse clade. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We simultaneously estimated the age of the angiosperms and the divergence times of key angiosperm lineages, using 36 calibration points for 567 taxa and a "relaxed clock" methodology that does not assume any correlation between rates, thus allowing for lineage-specific rate heterogeneity. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Based on the analysis for which we set fossils to fit lognormal priors, we obtained an estimated age of the angiosperms of 167-199 Ma and the following age estimates for major angiosperm clades: Mesangiospermae (139-156 Ma); Gunneridae (109-139 Ma); Rosidae (108-121 Ma); Asteridae (101-119 Ma). •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With the exception of the age of the angiosperms themselves, these age estimates are generally younger than other recent molecular estimates and very close to dates inferred from the fossil record. We also provide dates for all major angiosperm clades (including 45 orders and 335 families [208 stem group age only, 127 both stem and crown group ages], sensu APG III). Our analyses provide a new comprehensive source of reference dates for major angiosperm clades that we hope will be of broad utility.},

abstract = {There is an increased interest in phylogenetic approaches for conservation biology and community analysis. Many of these analyses are carried out using the Phylocom 4.2 package. With this computational tool, already existing trees are pruned to species from community to be studied. For plant communities, a variety of megatrees including all angiosperm families are available for phylogenetic community analysis. Using the bladj algorithm, internal nodes of community trees derived from these megatrees are calibrated on time scales from fossil or molecular data provided in an ages file. The higher precision of tree calibration, the better is the ecological interpretation if we assume that the closest related species have the most superposed set of traits, the highest probability of co-occurrence in case of environmental filter effects and the highest ratio of competitive exclusion. Together with the Phylocom 4.2 package comes an ages file based on Wikstrom's dating of angiosperm families (wikstrom.ages). But there are inconsistencies in syntax and/or nomenclature between internal node names of trees and the ages file from phylocom that influence the tree calibration and the subsequent analysis. To avoid that, we classified all online available megatrees according to their syntax and nomenclatureof internal nodes. For each of the four classes we provide a new, fully compatible ages file in the supplement material. Each online available megatree, pruned to the species from an example community from the Atlantic Rainforest, was calibrated twice running the bladj algorithm using once the original wikstrom.ages file and, additionally, the new ages file prepared for that tree class. Outcomes from trees calibrated by different methods have been compared. To avoid inconsistencies that push results beyond the realistic, we recommend a strict application of the four ages files provided as supplementary files. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Density dependence, environmental sorting and chance have been discussed for the purpose of understanding, predicting and explaining the species richness, composition and structural parameters of living communities. Different ecological mechanisms occur individually, such that they overlap and that the structure of each local community is influenced by an independent mixture of these factors. To identify which of these factors prevails in organizing the species-rich tree community from 100 plots of 10 x 10 m in a primary forest patch (the Forest of Seu Nico (FSN), from the Atlantic Forest domain), we analyzed species-environment correlations via canonical correspondence analysis and identified two different pedo-environments. We analyzed the community's phylogenetic structure using Phylocom 4.2 software to calculate the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI). Furthermore, we partitioned the total phylogenetic diversity into independent $\alpha$ and $\beta$ components ($\Pi$ST). To reveal the overlap of ecological mechanisms such as neutrality, environmental filtering and density-dependent factors, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure in both pedo-environments. The species-environment correlations observed in the FSN are weak in comparison with those found in other studies, although the permanent plot presents a short environmental gradient, dividing the plot into an upper, more acidic hillside and a lower, more fertile bottom. The overall phylogenetic structure of the FSN community shows a strong and significant phylogenetic overdispersion. This overdispersion indicates that density-dependent factors, such as interspecific competition, play an important role in maintaining the species richness and community structure in megadiverse ecosystems such as the FSN when we assume traits to be conserved within evolutionary lineages. The NRI and NTI are correlated positively with the soil pH and negatively with the soil's aluminum concentration, so the bottom plots show higher phylogenetic overdispersion and lower $\Pi$ST values than the hillside plots. This pattern can be explained by the greater importance of environmental filters in more acidic soils that form less favorable habitats, while the influence of competition and therefore the rate of competitive exclusion are higher in the more favorable, less acidic plots.},

abstract = {Aim Analyses of species distributions are complicated by various origins of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in biogeographical data. SAC may be particularly important for invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) because biological invasions are strongly influenced by dispersal and colonization processes that typically create highly structured distribution patterns. We examined the efficacy of using a multi-scale framework to account for different origins of SAC, and compared non-spatial models with models that accounted for SAC at multiple levels. Location We modelled the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, in western USA. Methods We applied one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model, GLM) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) to a large dataset on P. ramorum occurrence (n = 3787) to develop four types of model that included environmental variables and that either ignored spatial context or incorporated it at a broad scale using trend surface analysis, a local scale using autocovariates, or multiple scales using spatial eigenvector mapping. We evaluated model accuracies and amounts of explained spatial structure, and examined the changes in predictive power of the environmental and spatial variables. Results Accounting for different scales of SAC significantly enhanced the predictive capability of iSDMs. Dramatic improvements were observed when fine-scale SAC was included, suggesting that local range-confining processes are important in P. ramorum spread. The importance of environmental variables was relatively consistent across all models, but the explanatory power decreased in spatial models for factors with strong spatial structure. While accounting for SAC reduced the amount of residual autocorrelation for GLM but not for Maxent, it still improved the performance of both approaches, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal and colonization processes are important factors to consider in distribution models of biological invasions. Main conclusions Spatial autocorrelation has become a paradigm in biogeography and ecological modelling. In addition to avoiding the violation of statistical assumptions, accounting for spatial patterns at multiple scales can enhance our understanding of dynamic processes that explain ecological mechanisms of invasion and improve the predictive performance of static iSDMs.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {AimsUnderstanding what drives the variation in species composition and diversity among local communities can provide insights into the mechanisms of community assembly. Because ecological traits are often thought to be phylogenetically conserved, there should be patterns in phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity in local communities along ecological gradients. We investigate potential patterns in angiosperm assemblages along an elevational gradient with a steep ecological gradient in Changbaishan, China. MethodsWe used 13 angiosperm assemblages in forest plots (32x32 m) distributed along an elevational gradient from 720 to 1900 m above sea level. We used Faith's phylogenetic diversity metric to quantify the phylogenetic alpha diversity of each forest plot, used the net relatedness index to quantify the degree of phylogenetic relatedness among angiosperm species within each forest plot and used a phylogenetic dissimilarity index to quantify phylogenetic beta diversity among forest plots. We related the measures of phylogenetic structure and phylogenetic diversity to environmental (climatic and edaphic) factors. Important FindingsOur study showed that angiosperm assemblages tended to be more phylogenetically clustered at higher elevations in Changbaishan. This finding is consistent with the prediction of the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis, which highlights the role of niche constraints in governing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages. Our study also showed that woody assemblages differ from herbaceous assemblages in several major aspects. First, phylogenetic clustering dominated in woody assemblages, whereas phylogenetic overdispersion dominated in herbaceous assemblages; second, patterns in phylogenetic relatedness along the elevational and temperature gradients of Changbaishan were stronger for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages; third, environmental variables explained much more variations in phylogenetic relatedness, phylogenetic alpha diversity and phylogenetic beta diversity for woody assemblages than for herbaceous assemblages.},

abstract = {If interspecific competition is a strong structuring force of communities, ecologically similar species should tend to have spatial ranges at local scale that do not overlap. Experimental testing of this hypothesis becomes impracticable with large communities. One possibility to tackle this issue is a correlational approach, by comparing the matrix of niche overlap with that of spatial overlap. The use of the standard Mantel test is however impaired by the non-linearity in the relationship of the two descriptors: in a competitively structured assemblage, species with high niche overlap are expected to be segregated spatially, but species with small niche overlap may or may not exhibit high spatial overlap. To overcome this problem, we devised an original randomization test, which was run for three data-sets comprising frogs, lizards, and birds along altitudinal gradients. The test yielded intriguing results: reptiles and birds revealed an adjustment that would reduce the potential for interspecific competition, while amphibians showed the opposite trend, that is, ecologically similar species co-occurred more than expected by chance. Frogs may be more constrained by resource requirements, possibly breeding sites, than by competition. Our test will help to assess the generality of this pattern with other data-sets.},

abstract = {AimsWhile using phylogenetic and functional approaches to test the mechanisms of community assembly, functional traits often act as the proxy of niches. However, there is little detailed knowledge regarding the correlation between functional traits of tree species and their niches in local communities. We suggest that the co-varying correlation between functional traits and niches should be the premise for using phylogenetic and functional approaches to test mechanisms of community assembly. Using functional traits, phylogenetic and environmental data, this study aims to answer the questions: (i) within local communities, do functional traits of co-occurring species co-vary with their environmental niches at the species level? and (ii) what is the key ecological process underlying community assembly in Xishuangbanna and Ailaoshan forest dynamic plots (FDPs)? MethodsWe measured seven functional traits of 229 and 36 common species in Xishuangbanna and Ailaoshan FDPs in tropical and subtropical China, respectively. We also quantified the environmental niches for these species based on conditional probability. We then analyzed the correlations between functional traits and environmental niches using phylogenetic independent contrasts. After examining phylogenetic signals of functional traits using Pagel's {\{}lambda{\}}, we quantified the phylogenetic and functional dispersion along environmental gradients within local tree communities. Important FindingsFor target species, functional traits do co-vary with environmental niches at the species level in both of the FDPs, supporting that functional traits can be used as a proxy for local-scale environmental niches. Functional traits show significant phylogenetic signals in both of the FDPs. We found that the phylogenetic and functional dispersion were significantly clustered along topographical gradients in the Ailaoshan FDP but overdispersion in the Xishuangbanna FDP. These patterns of phylogenetic and functional dispersion suggest that environmental filtering plays a key role in structuring local tree assemblages in Ailaoshan FDP, while competition exclusion plays a key role in Xishuangbanna FDP.},

abstract = {Ecological communities and their response to environmental gradients are increasingly being described by measures of trait composition at the community level – the trait-based approach. Whether ecological or non-ecological processes influence trait composition between communities has been debated. Understanding the processes that influence trait composition is important for reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions from fossil deposits and for understanding changes in community functionality through time. Here, we assess the influence of ecological and non-ecological processes on the distribution of traits within North American mammals. We found that non-ecological processes including historical contingency, spatial autocorrelation, and evolutionary history do not influence trait composition; however, the variance in trait composition is highly explained by climate gradients. Our results suggest that habitat breadth, terrestriality, diet breadth, and reproductive traits are strong candidates as proxies for measuring functional aspects of environments in the past and present.},

@article{Miller2016,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Muelbert2016,
abstract = {Within the tropics, the species richness of tree communities is strongly and positively associated with precipitation. Previous research has suggested that this macroecological pattern is driven by the negative effect of water-stress on the physiological processes of most tree species. This process implies that the range limits of taxa are defined by their ability to occur under dry conditions, and thus in terms of species distributions it predicts a nested pattern of taxa distribution from wet to dry areas. However, this ‘dry-tolerance' hypothesis has yet to be adequately tested at large spatial and taxonomic scales. Here, using a dataset of 531 inventory plots of closed canopy forest distributed across the Western Neotropics we investigated how precipitation, evaluated both as mean annual precipitation and as the maximum climatological water deficit, influences the distribution of tropical tree species, genera and families. We find that the distributions of tree taxa are indeed nested along precipitation gradients in the western Neotropics. Taxa tolerant to seasonal drought are disproportionally widespread across the precipitation gradient, with most reaching even the wettest climates sampled; however, most taxa analysed are restricted to wet areas. Our results suggest that the ‘dry tolerance' hypothesis has broad applicability in the world's most species-rich forests. In addition, the large number of species restricted to wetter conditions strongly indicates that an increased frequency of drought could severely threaten biodiversity in this region. Overall, this study establishes a baseline for exploring how tropical forest tree composition may change in response to current and future environmental changes in this region.This article is protected by copyright.

@article{Pavoine2011a,
abstract = {One of the oldest challenges in ecology is to understand the processes that underpin the composition of communities. Historically, an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However, the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species, trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical, deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities. Research in this area has recently been advanced by the development of mathematical measures that incorporate trait dissimilarities and phylogenetic relatedness between species. However, measures of trait diversity have been developed independently of phylogenetic measures and converselymost of the phylogenetic diversitymeasures have been developed independently of trait diversity measures. This has led to semantic confusions particularly when classical ecological and evolutionary approaches are integrated so closely together.Consequently,we propose a unified semantic framework and demonstrate the importance of the links among species, phylogenetic and trait diversity indices. Furthermore, species, trait and phylogenetic diversity indices differ in the ways they can be used across different spatial scales. The connections between large-scale, regional and local processes allow the consideration of historical factors in addition to local ecological deterministic or stochastic processes. Phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used in large-scale analyses to determine how historical and/or environmental factors affect both the formation of species assemblages and patterns in species richness across latitude or elevation gradients. Both phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used at different spatial scales to identify the relative impacts of ecological deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and limiting similarity from alternative processes such as random speciation and extinction, random dispersal and ecological drift. Measures of phylogenetic diversity combine phenotypic and genetic diversity and have the potential to reveal both the ecological and historical factors that impact local communities. Consequently, we demonstrate that, when used in a comparative way, species, trait and phylogenetic structures have the potential to reveal essential details that might act simultaneously in the assembly of species communities.We highlight potential directions for future research. These might include how variation in trait and phylogenetic diversity alters with spatial distances, the role of trait and phylogenetic diversity in global-scale gradients, the connections between traits and phylogeny, the importance of trait rarity and independent evolutionary history in community assembly, the loss of trait and phylogenetic diversity due to human impacts, and the mathematical developments of biodiversity indices including within-species variations.},

abstract = {Herbaceous plants are a key component of tropical forests. Previous work indicates that herbs contribute substantially to the species richness of tropical plant communities. However, the processes structuring tropical herb diversity, and how they contrast with woody communities, have been underexplored. Within the understory of a 50-ha forest dynamics plot in central Panama, we compared the diversity, distribution, and abundance of vascular herbaceous plants with woody seedlings (i.e., tree and lianas {\textless} 1 cm DBH and ≥ 20 cm tall). Beta-diversity was calculated for each community using a null model approach. We then assessed the similarity in alpha and beta-diversity among herbs, tree seedlings, and liana seedlings. Strengths of habitat associations were measured using permutational ANOVA among topographic habitat-types. Variance partitioning was then used to quantify the amount of variation in species richness and composition explained by spatial and environmental variables (i.e., topography, soils, and shade) for each growth form. Species richness and diversity were highest for tree seedlings, followed by liana seedlings and then herbs. In contrast, beta-diversity was 16 to 127{\%} higher for herbs compared to woody seedlings, indicating higher spatial variation in this stratum. We observed no correlation between local richness or compositional uniqueness of herbs and woody seedlings across sites, indicating that different processes control the spatial patterns of woody and herbaceous diversity and composition. Habitat associations were strongest for herbs, as indicated by greater compositional dissimilarity among habitat types. Likewise, environmental variables explained a larger proportion of the variation in species richness and composition for herbs than for woody seedlings (richness = 25{\%}, 14{\%}, 12{\%}; composition = 25{\%}, 9{\%}, 6{\%}, for herbs, trees, and lianas, respectively). These differences between strata did not appear to be due to differences in lifespan alone, based on data from adult trees. Our results point to contrasting assembly mechanisms for herbaceous and woody communities, with herbs showing stronger niche-derived structure. Future research on tropical herbaceous communities is likely to yield new insights into the many processes structuring diverse plant communities. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {1. A common procedure in the regression analysis of interspecies data is to first test the independent and dependent variables X and Y for phylogenetic signal, and then use the presence of signal in one or both traits to justify regression analysis using phylogenetic methods such as independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized least squares. 2. This is incorrect, because phylogenetic regression assumes that the residual error in the regression model (not in the original traits) is distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution with variances and covariances proportional to the historical relations of the species in the sample. 3. Here, I examine the consequences of justifying and applying the phylogenetic regression incorrectly. I find that when used improperly the phylogenetic regression can have poor statistical performance, even under some circumstances in which the type I error rate of the method is not inflated over its nominal level. 4. I also find, however, that when tests of phylogenetic signal in phylogenetic regression are applied properly, and in particular when phylogenetic signal in the residual error is simultaneously estimated with the regression parameters, the phylogenetic regression outperforms equivalent non-phylogenetic procedures.},

abstract = {Aim To provide a mechanistic and probabilistic framework for defining the species pool based on species-specific probabilities of dispersal, environmental suitability and biotic interactions within a specific temporal extent, and to show how probabilistic species pools can help disentangle the geographical structure of different community assembly processes. Innovation Probabilistic species pools provide an improved species pool definition based on probabilities in conjunction with the associated species list, which explicitly recognize the indeterminate nature of species pool membership for a given focal unit of interest and better capture real-world complexity. Probabilistic species pools provide a quantitative assessment of how dispersal, environmental or biotic factors influence estimates of species pool composition and size for a given temporal extent. Conclusions Based on one simulated and two empirical examples we demonstrate that probabilistic species pools allow us to disentangle the geographical variation in dispersal, environmental and biotic assembly processes for species assemblages in focal units. We also show that probabilistic species pools are fully compatible with traditional definitions of species pools and are applicable over a wide range of spatial and temporal extents. Additionally they are robust to missing data and provide a quantified and transparent approach to estimating the size and composition of species pools in a mechanistic way, providing a valuable tool for studies from community ecology to macroecology.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

@article{Laughlin2012a,
abstract = {Community assembly involves two antagonistic processes that select functional traits in opposite directions. Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

@article{Lessard2016,
abstract = {A persistent challenge in ecology is to tease apart the in- fluence of multiple processes acting simultaneously and interacting in complex ways to shape the structure of species assemblages. We implement a heuristic approach that relies on explicitly defining spe- cies pools and permits assessment of the relative influence of themain processes thought to shape assemblage structure: environmental fil- tering, dispersal limitations, and biotic interactions. We illustrate our approach using data on the assemblage composition and geographic distribution of hummingbirds, a comprehensive phylogeny and mor- phological traits. The implementation of several process-based species pool definitions in null models suggests that temperature—but not pre- cipitation or dispersal limitation—acts as the main regional filter of as- semblage structure. Incorporating this environmental filter directly into the definition of assemblage-specific species pools revealed an other- wise hidden pattern of phylogenetic evenness, indicating that biotic in- teractions might further influence hummingbird assemblage structure. Such hidden patterns of assemblage structure call for a reexamination of a multitude of phylogenetic- and trait-based studies that did not ex- plicitly consider potentially important processes in their definition of the species pool. Our heuristic approach provides a transparent way to explore patterns and refine interpretations of the underlying causes of assemblage structure.},

abstract = {The Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar have different histories which have influenced their respective patterns of diversity. Based on current knowledge of these histories, we developed the following predictions about the phylogenetic structure and composition of rainforest tree communities: (Hypothesis 1) isolation of Gondwanan biotas generated differences in phylogenetic composition among biogeographical regions; (H2) major Cenozoic extinction events led to lack of phylogenetic structure in Afrotropical and Malagasy communities; (H3) greater angiosperm diversification in the Neotropics led to greater phylogenetic clustering there than elsewhere; (H4) phylogenetic overdispersion is expected near the Andes due to the co-occurrence of magnoliids tracking conserved habitat preferences and recently diversified eudicot lineages. Using abundance data of tropical rainforest tree species from 94 communities in the Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar, we computed net relatedness index (NRI) to assess local phylogenetic structure, i.e. phylogenetic clustering vs. overdispersion relative to regional species pools, and principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS) to assess variation in phylogenetic composition across communities. We observed significant differences in phylogenetic composition among biogeographical regions (agreement with H1). Overall phylogenetic structure did not differ among biogeographical regions, but results indicated variation from Andes to Amazon. We found widespread phylogenetic randomness in most Afrotropical and all Malagasy communities (agreement with H2). Most of Central Amazonian communities were phylogenetically random, although some communities presented phylogenetic clustering (partial agreement with H3). We observed phylogenetic overdispersion near the Andes (agreement with H4). We were able to identify how differences in lineage composition are related to local phylogenetic co-occurrences across biogeographical regions that have been undergoing different climatic and orographic histories during the past 100 Myr. We observed imprints of the history following Gondwana breakup on phylobetadiversity and local phylogenetic structure of rainforest tree communities in the Neotropics, Afrotropics and Madagascar.

abstract = {1. Quantifying functional trait diversity has provided important new insights for understanding ecosystem processes and functioning. Functional diversity is often partitioned into three components, richness, evenness, and divergence. Currently, a convex hull is used as a measure of multivariate richness, but this approach has some serious limitations. 2. Consequently, we propose using the number of Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) as an approach to measure the filled trait space (the hypervolume containing all possible trait combinations), and propose a new index, sUTC as the amount of filled trait space divided by the trait space range. Like convex hull approaches, UTC can be partitioned into alpha and beta components when used across sites, and the beta component can be further partitioned into turnover and nestedness components. Unlike convex hull approaches, Accepted Article UTC can be used more intuitively with existing diversity measures as it can be used in conjunction with abundance information. We present the concepts these indices are based on and give examples of their use. The new index, sUTC, is compared to the existing indices on the basis of criteria specified in the literature and one novel criterion. We test and evaluate the approach using simulated data and field data. 3. We found that the UTC approach provided a more accurate assessment of functional richness than did the existing indices. 4. The UTC approach is a multivariate approach to measuring functional richness that can accommodate continuous and categorical traits and can account for holes in the trait space.},

abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

abstract = {Functional trait analysis is an appealing approach to study differences among biological communities because traits determine species' responses to the environment and their impacts on ecosystem functioning. Despite a rapidly expanding quantitative literature, it remains challenging to conceptualize concurrent changes in multiple trait dimensions (“trait space”) and select quantitative functional diversity methods to test hypotheses prior to analysis. To address this need, we present a widely applicable framework for visualizing ecological phenomena in trait space to guide the selection, application, and interpretation of quantitative functional diversity methods. We describe five hypotheses that represent general patterns of responses to disturbance in functional community ecology and then apply a formal decision process to determine appropriate quantitative methods to test ecological hypotheses. As a part of this process, we devise a new statistical approach to test for functional turnover among communities. Our combination of hypotheses and metrics can be applied broadly to address ecological questions across a range of systems and study designs. We illustrate the framework with a case study of disturbance in freshwater communities. This hypothesis-driven approach will increase the rigor and transparency of applied functional trait studies.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {A cornerstone of environmental policy is the debate over protecting nature for humans' sake (instrumental values) or for nature's (intrinsic values) (1). We propose that focusing only on instrumental or intrinsic values may fail to resonate with views on personal and col- lective well-being, or “what is right,” with regard to nature and the environment. Without complementary attention to other ways that value is expressed and realized by people, such a focus may inadvertently promote worldviews at odds with fair and desirable futures. It is time to engage seriously with a third class of values, one with diverse roots and current expres- sions: relational values. By doing so, we reframe the discussion about environmental protection, and open the door to new, potentially more productive policy approaches.},

abstract = {Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries. The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.},

abstract = {1. Large-scale species occurrence data from geo-referenced observations and collected specimens are crucial for analyses in ecology, evolution and biogeography. Despite the rapidly growing availability of such data, their use in evolutionary analyses is often hampered by tedious manual classification of point occurrences into operational areas, leading to a lack of reproducibility and concerns regarding data quality. 2. Here we present speciesgeocodeR, a user-friendly R-package for data cleaning, data exploration and data visualization of species point occurrences using discrete operational areas, and linking them to analyses invoking phylogenetic trees. 3. The three core functions of the package are 1) automated and reproducible data cleaning, 2) rapid and reproducible classification of point occurrences into discrete operational areas in an adequate format for subsequent biogeographic analyses, and 3) a comprehensive summary and visualization of species distributions to explore large datasets and ensure data quality. In addition, speciesgeocodeR facilitates the access and analysis of publicly available species occurrence data, widely used operational areas and elevation ranges. Other functionalities include the implementation of minimum occurrence thresholds and the visualization of coexistence patterns and range sizes. SpeciesgeocodeR accompanies a richly illustrated and easy-to-follow tutorial and help functions.},

abstract = {The notion that relationships between community-weighted mean (CWM) traits (i.e. plot-level trait values weighted by species abundances) and environmental conditions reflect selection towards locally optimal phenotypes is challenged by the large amount of interspecific trait variation typically found within ecological communities. Reconciling these contrasting patterns is a key to advancing predictive theories of functional community ecology. We combined data on geographical distributions and three traits (wood density, leaf mass per area and maximum height) of 173 tree species in Puerto Rico. We tested the hypothesis that species are more likely to occur where their trait values are more similar to the local CWM trait values (the'CWM-optimality' hypothesis) by comparing species occurrence patterns (as a proxy for fitness) with the functional composition of forest plots across a precipitation gradient. While 70{\%} of the species supported CWM-optimality for at least one trait, nearly 25{\%} significantly opposed it for at least one trait, thereby contributing to local functional diversity. The majority (85{\%}) of species that opposed CWM-optimality did so only for one trait and few species opposed CWM-optimality in multivariate trait space. Our study suggests that constraints to local functional variation act more strongly on multivariate phenotypes than on univariate traits.},

abstract = {Approaches using phylogenetic pattern in ecological communities to deduce processes of community assembly have been criticised as disconnected from foundations in ecological mechanism, especially with respect to lack of data about abiotic and biotic niches. These criticisms can be addressed with analyses of organismal traits that underlie environmental filtering, competitive exclusion, and other candidate processes; however, the difficulty of assembling large trait databases means that such studies remain uncommon. We suggest a synthesis of phylogenetic community structure analysis and species distribution modeling that we believe can allow inference about community processes without prohibitive data requirements. We illustrate this method for angiosperm communities of rock barrens in eastern Canada. First, we analyzed phylogenetic community structure of four rock-barren sites at three nested spatial scales (quadrat to region). For the nine most common species in our barrens, we used regional occurrence records to build species distribution models identifying environmental drivers of the nine species' distributions. Coefficients of these models represent implicit trait data that summarize each species' response to the environmental drivers in the model. We then tested for phylogenetic signal in these traits, to ask whether ecological forces acting on them could be generating phylogenetic community structure. We found strong phylogenetic clustering at the quadrat level, while patterns at larger scales were complex. Our distribution model suggested drought stress as the dominant driver for distributions of all the species, consistent with local correlations with soil depth, and the species' responses to drought showed strong phylogenetic signal. The convergence of results from phylogenetic community structure and species distribution modeling suggests that barren communities are structured at the quadrat level by environmental filtering effects of moisture stress, to which species have phylogenetically patterned responses.},

abstract = {Species diversity promotes the delivery of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality). However, the relative functional importance of rare and common species in driving the biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship remains unknown. We studied the relationship between the diversity of rare and common species (according to their local abundances and across nine different trophic groups), and multifunctionality indices derived from 14 ecosystem functions on 150 grasslands across a land-use intensity (LUI) gradient. The diversity of above- and below-ground rare species had opposite effects, with rare above-ground species being associated with high levels of multifunctionality, probably because their effects on different functions did not trade off against each other. Conversely, common species were only related to average, not high, levels of multifunctionality, and their functional effects declined with LUI. Apart from the community-level effects of diversity, we found significant positive associations between the abundance of individual species and multifunctionality in 6{\%} of the species tested. Species-specific functional effects were best predicted by their response to LUI: species that declined in abundance with land use intensification were those associated with higher levels of multifunctionality. Our results highlight the importance of rare species for ecosystem multifunctionality and help guiding future conservation priorities.},

abstract = {Three stem-mapped field plots, each representing a specific forest developmental stage, were established in a temperate forest in Northeastern China: a young secondary conifer and broadleaved mixed forest (YSF), an old secondary conifer and broadleaved mixed forest (OSF), and an old-growth Korean pine and broad-leaf forest (OGF). The focus of this study is to test an environmental control hypothesis. The spatial variations of community structure (species diversity, forest density and size differentiation) were partitioned into pure environment, pure space, and spatially-structured environmental processes in the three research plots. The principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNMs) method was included in??the procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. The significant PCNM variables could be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales. The results indicate that the explanatory power of the soil data was much greater in the secondary forests (YSF and/or OSF) than in the old-growth forest regarding species diversity, forest density and size differentiation. Nearly half (48.35{\%} and 44.86{\%}) of the variation of species richness was explained by soil properties in the young secondary forest and the old secondary forest, respectively. However, only 4.87{\%} of that variation was explained by soil properties in the old-growth forest. Over 14{\%} of the variation of the tree size differentiation was explained by soil properties in two secondary forests, and only 4.23{\%} in the old-growth forest. In this study, the spatial variation of species richness and size differentiation was related to environmental variables at multiple scales. Soil variables had a significant effect on species richness and size differentiation at broader scales in the secondary forests, but mainly at medium and fine scales in the old-growth forest. The results challenge the commonly held assumption that tree distributions simply reflect patterns of seed dispersal at local scales. Crown Copyright ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Owing to the conceptual complexity of functional diversity (FD), a multitude of different methods are available for measuring it, with most being operational at only a small range of spatial scales. This causes uncertainty in ecological interpretations and limits the potential to generalize findings across studies or compare patterns across scales. We solve this problem by providing a unified framework expanding on and integrating existing approaches. The framework, based on trait probability density (TPD), is the first to fully implement the Hutchinsonian concept of the niche as a probabilistic hypervolume in estimating FD. This novel approach could revolutionize FD-based research by allowing quantification of the various FD components from organismal to macroecological scales, and allowing seamless transitions between scales. Functional trait diversity, in other words the variation of traits between organisms, can be used to address a great number of pressing ecological questions. Consequently, trait-based approaches are increasingly being used by ecologists.However, functional diversity comprises several components that can be evaluated at different spatial scales. Because of this conceptual complexity, there is an overabundance of disparate approaches for estimating it, which leads to confusion among users and hampers the comparability of different studies.A single mathematical framework encompassing different approaches while providing a seamless continuity between spatial scales is needed.Reconciling the approaches based on the concept of the niche as a hypervolume and those that consider traits in probabilistic terms is the first step towards the foundation of a unified framework.},

abstract = {Assembly rules are ecological processes imposed on a regional species bank to establish the structure of communities and define diversity patterns regarding space and time. Here, we investigated the trait distribution of periphytic algae in floodplain lakes that are naturally under contrasting environmental pressures with and without flood pulse action (low and high water phases) and the relationship between functional traits and environmental variables at regional and local scales. We hypothesized that functional clustering will be related to the low water phase in local scale, based on environment filters, and functional overdispersion to the high water phase in regional scale. With respect to traits, we can expect that the flood pulse would favored the prevalence of nanoperiphyton, filamentous forms and loosely attached. For this, we conducted a two-year assessment of the structure and dynamic of periphytic algae communities regarding their functional traits in lakes belonging to two sub-basins in a subtropical floodplain (upper Paran{\'{a}} River floodplain). The samplings occurred during the high water phase in 2010 and 2011 and the low water phase in 2011. The functional diversity values of the communities were quantified and compared with the mean value of communities randomly generated using null models. The relationships between functional traits and environmental variables were examined using RLQ analysis. We have shown that the traits respond to abiotic factors, and they indicated overdispersion in high water phase, and higher functional diversity in most preserved environments with absence of the pulse. The flood pulse favored the prevalence of colonial life form, stalked, entangled and heterotrichous species. This study showed spatial and temporal differences in the limnological characteristics between the lakes caused by hydrological phase and local forces in different sub-basins and the importance mainly of assimilable nutrients in the evaluation of trait-environment relationships. The overdispersion result can be assigned to flood pulse, which promotes a higher probability of dispersion and colonization of new areas for rare species, disturbance and more heterogeneous habitats, allowing opportunities for resource partitioning and regeneration of different species strategies. Moreover, the higher periphytic algae functional diversity in preserved sites emphasizes the importance of understanding ecological patterns linked to environmental degradation, as well as of conservation initiatives, because variation in periphytic algal communities implies in changes in the trophic structure, dynamics and in the functioning of environments.},

This is mostly due to the fact that even if a preliminary result has been reconstructed, there is no definitive answer as to whether or not a better result with more consistently retrieved phases can still be obtained. We show here that the first step in data analysis, the assembly of two-dimensional diffraction patterns from a large set of raw diffraction data, is crucial to obtaining reconstructions of highest possible consistency. We have developed software that automates this process and results in consistently accurate diffraction patterns. We have furthermore derived some criteria of validity for a tool commonly used to assess the consistency of reconstructions, the phase retrieval transfer function, and suggest a modified version that has improved utility for judging reconstruction quality.},

abstract = {The assumption that traits and phylogenies can be used as proxies of species niche has faced criticisms. Evidence suggested that phylogenic relatedness is a weak proxy of trait similarity. Moreover, different processes can select different traits, giving opposing signals in null model analyses. To circumvent these criti- cisms, we separated traits of stream insects based on the concept of a and b niches, which should give clues about assembling pressures expected to act independently of each other. We investigated the congruence between the phy- logenetic structure and trait structure of communities using all available traits and all possible combinations of traits (4095 combinations). To account for hierarchical assembling processes, we analyzed patterns on two spatial scales with three pools of genera. Beta niche traits selected a priori – i.e., traits related to environmental variation (e.g., respiration type) – were consistently clustered on the smaller scale, suggesting environmental filtering, while a niche traits – i.e., traits related to resource use (e.g., trophic position) – did not display the expected overdispersion, suggesting a weak role of competition. Using all traits together provided random patterns and the analysis of all possible combina- tions of traits provided scenarios ranging from strong clustering to overdisper- sion. Communities were phylogenetically overdispersed, a pattern previously interpreted as phylogenetic limiting similarity. However, our results likely reflect the co-occurrence of ancient clades due to the stability of stream habitats along the evolutionary scale. We advise ecologists to avoid using combinations of all available traits but rather carefully traits based on the objective under consideration. Both trait and phylogenetic approaches should be kept in the ecologist toolbox, but phylogenetic distances should not be used as proxies of traits differences. Although the phylogenetic structure revealed processes operat- ing at the evolutionary scale, only specific traits explained local processes oper- ating in our communities.},

This study addressed the effects of topographic aspect and vegetation community types on soil physical and chemical properties in the Bale Mountains, south-eastern highlands of Ethiopia. At each stratified vegetation community; Schefflera-Hagenia, Hypericum-Erica-Schefflera, and Erica arborea (shrub size), and in each of the four topographic aspects, four representative soil profiles giving a total of 3 ?? 4 ?? 4 = 48 were opened and described. Soil texture, bulk density, soil pH, plant available phosphorus, CEC, exchangeable base cations, and percent base saturations were analyzed and interpreted. Except in few cases, all considered soil properties showed significant differences among vegetation communities and topographic aspects. The differences may be attributed to leaching and differences in organic matter (carbon) contents within the soil profiles due to topographic aspect-induced microclimatic differences, reflecting the response of vegetation communities to the conditions. Soil textural fractions, mainly silt and clay, bulk density, pH, plant available phosphorus, percent base saturation, CEC, and exchangeable base cations generally increased in the Schefflera-Hagenia vegetation community zone.

abstract = {Aim The study aims to decipher the co-occurrence of understorey plant assemblages and, accordingly, to identify a set of species groups (diversity deconstruction) to better understand the multiple causal processes underlying post-fire succession and diversity patterns in boreal forest. Location North-eastern Canadian boreal forest (49 degrees 07'-51 degrees 44' N; 70 degrees 13'-65 degrees 15' W). Methods Data on understorey plant communities and habitat factors were collected from 1097 plots. Species co-occurrence was analysed using null model analysis. We derive species groups (i.e. biodiversity deconstruction) using the strength of pairwise species co-occurrences after accounting for random expectation under a null model and cluster analyses. We examine the influence of a set of spatiotemporal environmental variables (overstorey composition, time-since-fire, spatial location and topography) on richness of species groups using Bayesian model averaging, and their relative influence through hierarchical partitioning of variance. Results Understorey plant assemblages were highly structured, with co-occurrence-based classification providing species groups that were coherently aggregated within, but variably segregated between, species groups. Group richness models indicate both common and distinct responses to factors affecting plant succession. For example, Group 2 (e.g. Rhododendron groenlandicum and Cladina rangiferina) showed concurrent contrasting responses to overstorey composition and was strongly segregated from Groups 3 (e.g. Clintonia borealis and Maianthenum canadense) and 4 (e.g. Epilobium angustifolium and Alnus rugosa). Groups 3 and 4 showed partial similarity, but they differed in their response to time-since-fire, drainage and latitude, which were more important for Group 1 (e.g. Ptilium crista-castrensis and Empetrum nigrum). A single successional model based on total richness masked crucial group-level relationships with factors that we examined, such as latitude. Main conclusions By demonstrating the co-occurrence structure and linking to causal factors, the results from this study characterize both common and distinct responses of understorey plants to biophysical attributes of sites, and potential interspecific interactions, behind non-random assemblage structure during post-fire succession. A biodiversity deconstruction approach could offer a concise and explicit framework to gain a better understanding of the complex assembly of ecological communities during succession.},

The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species' climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification.},

abstract = {Tropical tree communities present one of the most challenging systems for studying the processes underlying community assembly. Most community assembly hypotheses consider the relative importance of the ecological similarity of co-occurring species. Quantifying this similarity is a daunting and potentially impossible task in species-rich assemblages. During the past decade tropical tree ecologists have increasingly utilized phylogenetic trees and functional traits to estimate the ecological similarity of species in order to test mechanistic community assembly hypotheses. A large amount of work has resulted with many important advances having been made along the way. That said, there are still many outstanding challenges facing those utilizing phylogenetic and functional trait approaches to study community assembly. Here I review the conceptual background, major advances and major remaining challenges in phylogenetic- and trait-based approaches to community ecology with a specific focus on tropical trees. I argue that both approaches tremendously improve our understanding of tropical tree community ecology, but neither approach has fully reached its potential thus far.},

abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},

The results showed that SOC and total N in the top 0.3 m depth varied significantly among vegetation communities (p {\textless} 0.001) and aspects (p = 0.003). At all aspects studied, the overall mean SOC and total N amounts to a depth of 1.0 m ranged from 32.67 to 46.03 kg C m- 2 and 2.89 to 3.61 kg N m- 2 among the vegetation communities. The overall mean SOC and total N stocks to a depth of 1.0 m varied from 35.13 to 44.97 kg C m- 2 and 2.90 to 3.75 kg N m- 2 among aspects. Topographic aspect induced microclimatic differences and vegetation community types were found to be important factors for the significant variations in SOC and total N stocks in the Bale Mountains. About 45{\%} of the SOC stock in the 0-1.0 m layer of the mineral soil was held in the top 0.3 m of the soil, indicating the potentially large amount of CO2 that can be released from the top surface soils when these vegetations are deforested and converted into grazing and cultivation. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The beta diversity component, which incorporates both alpha and gamma diversity components, is ideal for studying scale issues of diversity. We explore the scale dependency of beta diversity and scale relationship, both theoretically as well as by application to actual data sets. Our results showed that a power law exists for beta diversity-area (spatial grain or spatial extent) relationships, and that the parameters of the power law are dependent on the grain and extent for which the data are defined. Coarse grain size generates a steeper slope (scaling exponent z) with lower values of intercept (c), while a larger extent results in a reverse trend in both parameters. We also found that, for a given grain (with varying extent) or a given extent (with varying grain) the two parameters are themselves related by power laws. These findings are important because they are the first to simultaneously relate the various components of scale and di- versity in a unified manner. Abbreviations:},

abstract = {1.Metacommunity phylogenetics aims at evaluating environmental and/or historical factors driving clade distribution. Phylogenetic fuzzy weighting (PFW) describes clade distribution across metacommunities based on fuzzy sets defined by phylogenetic relatedness among species. The method enables analysing environmental and/or biogeographic determinants of clade distribution. PFW also offers an exploratory tool for visualizing clade distribution via Principal Coordinates of Phylogenetic Structure (PCPS). In this article we describe the theoretical properties and biological backgrounds of PFW, and evaluate its statistical performance (type I error and statistical power) in assessing environmental and phylogenetic determinants of species distribution in comparison with other phylobetadiversity methods (COMDIST, COMDISTNT, Rao's H and UniFrac). 2.The statistical performance of PFW and the other phylobetadiversity metrics was tested by (1) simulating metacommunities under different species assembly scenarios (species distribution influenced or not by environment and/or phylogeny), niche breadth tolerance and species pool sizes; (2) submitting community matrices to PFW and deriving pairwise phylogenetic dissimilarities between communities (DP) and PCPS; (3) submitting these metrics and the other phylobetadiversity methods to different analytical approaches (Mantel test, regression on dissimilarity matrices – ADONIS, and GLM) to evaluate the influence of environment and phylogeny on metacommunity phylogenetic structure; and (4) estimating type I error and power estimates via alternative permutation procedures. 3.Results demonstrated that PFW provides robust assessment of environmental and phylogenetic drivers of species distribution across metacommunities. Although all methods had acceptable type I error for both Mantel test and ADONIS, only PFW showed acceptable power for both tests. Rao's H had acceptable power only for Mantel test, while COMDIST had acceptable power only for ADONIS. COMDISTNT and UniFrac showed poor statistical performance for both tests. Conversely, GLM had acceptable power only for the first PCPS. 4.Performing ADONIS on DP provides a robust overall assessment of environmental and phylogenetic drivers of species distribution. On the other hand, performing PCPS analysis after rejecting the null hypotheses via ADONIS allows identifying the phylogenetic nodes mostly associated with environmental gradients. PFW enables synthesizing and analysing phylogenetic patterns in metacommunities, allowing attaining a more complete portrait of ecological and evolutionary drivers of species distribution.

These still largely untested predictions complicate Darwin's hypothesis that more closely related species less easily coexist, and challenge the use of community phylogenetic patterns to infer com-petition. We field parameterised models of competitor dynamics with pairs of 18 California annual plant species, and then related species' niche and fitness differences to their phylogenetic distance. Stabilising niche differences were unrelated to phylogenetic distance, while species' average fitness showed phylogenetic structure. This meant that more distant relatives had greater competitive asymmetry, which should favour the coexistence of close relatives. Nonetheless, coexistence proved unrelated to phylogeny, due in part to increasing variance in fitness differences with phylo-genetic distance, a previously overlooked property of such relationships. Together, these findings question the expectation that distant relatives should more readily coexist.},

We compare measures of beta diversity, phylogenetic community structure and phylobetadiversity (phylogenetic distance among communities) in 34 plots of Amazonian trees across white-sand and clay terra firme forests in a 60 000 square kilometer area in Loreto, Peru. Dominant taxa in white-sand forests were phylogenetically clustered, consistent with environmental filtering of conserved traits. Phylobetadiversity measures found significant phylogenetic clustering between terra firme communities separated by geographic distances of {\textless} 200-300 km, consistent within recent local speciation at the watershed scale in the Miocene-aged clay-soil forests near the foothills of the Andes. Although both distance and habitat type yielded statistically significant effects on both species and phylogenetic turnover, the patterns we observed were more consistent with an effect of habitat specialization than dispersal limitation. Our results suggest a role for both broad-scale biogeographic and evolutionary processes, as well as habitat specialization, influencing community structure in Amazonian forests.},

abstract = {One of ecology's grand challenges is developing general rules to explain and predict highly complex systems. Understanding and predicting ecological processes from species' traits has been considered a 'Holy Grail' in ecology. Plant functional traits are increasingly being used to develop mechanistic models that can predict how ecological communities will respond to abiotic and biotic perturbations and how species will affect ecosystem function and services in a rapidly changing world; however, significant challenges remain. In this review, we highlight recent work and outstanding questions in three areas: (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the characterization of plant strategies based on traits and trait relationships, and the integration of traits into multivariate indices and models of community and ecosystem function. However, the utility of trait-based approaches in ecology will benefit from efforts that demonstrate how these traits and indices influence organismal, community, and ecosystem processes across vegetation types, which may be achieved through meta-analysis and enhancement of trait databases. Additionally, intraspecific trait variation and species interactions need to be incorporated into predictive models using tools such as Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Finally, existing models linking traits to community and ecosystem processes need to be empirically tested for their applicability to be realized.},

abstract = {Functional trait diversity is a popular tool in modern ecology, mainly used to infer assembly processes and ecosystem functioning. Patterns of functional trait diversity are shaped by ecological processes such as environmental filtering, species interactions and dispersal that are inherently spatial, and different processes may operate at different spatial scales. Adding a spatial dimension to the analysis of functional trait diversity may thus increase our ability to infer community assembly processes and to predict change in assembly processes following disturbance or land-use change. Richness, evenness and divergence of functional traits are commonly used indices of functional trait diversity that are known to respond differently to large-scale filters related to environmental heterogeneity and dispersal and fine-scale filters related to species interactions (competition). Recent developments in spatial statistics make it possible to separately quantify large-scale patterns (variation in local means) and fine-scale patterns (variation around local means) by decomposing overall spatial autocorrelation quantified by Moran's coefficient into its positive and negative components using Moran eigenvector maps (MEM). We thus propose to identify the spatial signature of multiple ecological processes that are potentially acting at different spatial scales by contrasting positive and negative components of spatial autocorrelation for each of the three indices of functional trait diversity. We illustrate this approach with a case study from riparian plant communities, where we test the effects of disturbance on spatial patterns of functional trait diversity. The fine-scale pattern of all three indices was increased in the disturbed versus control habitat, suggesting an increase in local scale competition and an overall increase in unexplained variance in the post-disturbance versus control community. Further research using simulation modeling should focus on establishing the proposed link between community assembly rules and spatial patterns of functional trait diversity to maximize our ability to infer multiple processes from spatial community structure.},

abstract = {This Special Feature of the Journal of Vegetation Science contains ten contributions from the 56th Symposium of the International Association for Vegetation Science (IAVS), which was held in Tartu, Estonia, 26–30 Jun 2013, and focused on processes underlying vegetation patterns. These contributions give an overview of recent advances in vegetation science, with topics ranging from the introduction of new methods and ideas to comprehensive analysis of vegetation patterns on a global scale. The focus of these Special Feature contributions indicates that vegetation science is becoming more global, more complex and more interdisciplinary. It is likely that progress in methods and accumulation of data have led vegetation science into a ‘new era of discovery'.},

abstract = {Topography can create substantial environmental variation at fine spatial scales. Shaped by slope, aspect, hill-position, and elevation, topoclimate heterogeneity may increase ecological diversity, and act as a spatial buffer for vegetation responding to climate change. Strong links have been observed between climate heterogeneity and species diversity at broader scales, but the importance of topoclimate for woody vegetation across small spatial extents merits closer examination. We established woody vegetation monitoring plots in mixed evergreen-deciduous woodlands that spanned topoclimate gradients of a topographically heterogeneous landscape in northern California. We investigated the association between the structure of adult and regenerating size classes of woody vegetation and multidimensional topoclimate at a fine scale. We found a significant effect of topoclimate on both single-species distributions and community composition. Effects of topoclimate were evident in the regenerating size class for all dominant species (four Quercus spp., Umbellularia californica, and Pseudotsuga menziesii) but only in two dominant species (Quercus agrifolia and Quercus garryana) for the adult size class. Adult abundance was correlated with water balance parameters (e.g., climatic water deficit) and recruit abundance was correlated with an interaction between the topoclimate parameters and conspecific adult abundance (likely reflecting local seed dispersal). However, in all cases, the topoclimate signal was weak. The magnitude of environmental variation across our study site may be small relative to the tolerance of long-lived woody species. Dispersal limitations, management practices, and patchy disturbance regimes also may interact with topoclimate, weakening its influence on woody vegetation distributions. Our study supports the biological relevance of multidimensional topoclimate for mixed woodland communities, but highlights that this relationship might be mediated by interacting factors at local scales.},

abstract = {Beta diversity patterns are the outcome of multiple processes operating at different scales. Amphibian assemblages seem to be affected by contemporary climate and dispersal-based processes. However, historical processes involved in present patterns of beta diversity remain poorly understood. We assess and disentangle geomorphological, climatic and spatial drivers of amphibian beta diversity in coastal lowlands of the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that geomorphological factors are more important in structuring anuran beta diversity than climatic and spatial factors. We obtained species composition via field survey (N = 766 individuals), museum specimens (N = 9,730) and literature records (N = 4,763). Sampling area was divided in four spatially explicit geomorphological units, representing historical predictors. Climatic descriptors were represented by the first two axis of a Principal Component Analysis. Spatial predictors in different spatial scales were described by Moran Eigenvector Maps. Redundancy Analysis was implemented to partition the explained variation of species composition by geomorphological, climatic and spatial predictors. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to test neutral theory predictions. Beta diversity was spatially structured in broader scales. Shared fraction between climatic and geomorphological variables was an important predictor of species composition (13{\%}), as well as broad scale spatial predictors (13{\%}). However, geomorphological variables alone were the most important predictor of beta diversity (42{\%}). Historical factors related to geomorphology must have played a crucial role in structuring amphibian beta diversity. The complex relationships between geomorphological history and climatic gradients generated by the Serra do Mar Precambrian basements were also important. We highlight the importance of combining spatially explicit historical and contemporary predictors for understanding and disentangling major drivers of beta diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Question

Are plant traits more closely correlated with mean annual temperature, or with mean annual precipitation?


Location

Global.


Methods

We quantified the strength of the relationships between temperature and precipitation and 21 plant traits from 447,961 species-site combinations worldwide. We used meta-analysis to provide an overall answer to our question.


Results

Mean annual temperature was significantly more strongly correlated with plant traits than was mean annual precipitation.


Conclusions

Our study provides support for some of the assumptions of classical vegetation theory, and points to many interesting directions for future research. The relatively low R2 values for precipitation might reflect the weak link between mean annual precipitation and the availability of water to plants.},

@article{Feller1997,
abstract = {Management of soil organic matter (SOM) is esential to sustaining the quality and productivity of soils around the globe. This appears to be particularly true in the tropics where there is a greater proportion of nutrient poor, highly weathered soils that are more susceptible to losses of SOM. Developing management practices that promote the maintenance and storage of SOM in the tropics depends on understanding the factors that control SOM dynamics. This paper describes the role that soil physical properties (mineralogy, texture, and structure) play in regulating the accumulation and loss of SOM in tropical soils. Two different approaches are presented here. The first approach explores relationships between total SOM and soil physical properties in the tropics. These include effects of climate and mineralogy on latitudinal gradients in SOM, interactions between texture and mineralogy as determinants of SOM storage and relationships between SOM and the structural stability of soils. The second approach describes characteristics of SOM associated with different physical constituents of the soil, with particular attention to particle-size fractions and aggregated particles of different sizes. In each case we summarise findings on the distribution of SOM among fractions and characterise its biochemical composition, bioavailability and turnover. Evidence for and against the physical protection of organic matter from microbial attack in tropical soils is also given. Wherever possible, we compare and contrast the findings for tropical soils with those of temperate soils. The influence of landuse management on physical control of SOM dynamics is discussed as an overriding factor with each aproach.},

@article{Maynard2016,
abstract = {Growing concern over climate and management induced changes to soil nutrient status has prompted interest in understanding the spatial distribution of forest soil properties. Recent advancements in remotely sensed geospatial technologies are providing an increasing array of data sources (e.g., LiDAR, hyper-spectral imagery) relating to forest biophysical properties. While these data sources have the potential to improve spatial predictions of forest soil properties, considerable uncertainty exists regarding which remotely sensed (RS) indices are correlated to soil variability and what underlying pedogenic processes connect them. The main objective of this study was to identify and interpret RS indices that account for soil variability within a 2300 ha forested watershed. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning methods were used to uncouple the complexity of soil-environmental relationships. Thirty-two soil pedons were described, sampled, characterized and analyzed for 22 soil properties within the 0-50 cm soil depth interval. A suite of environmental covariates, comprised of LiDAR derived canopy metrics, land-surface and hydrologic terrain indices, broad-band remotely sensed indices (GeoEye-1), and narrow-band hyper-spectral indices (HyMap), were used as covariates in our RDA models. Principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) was used to disentangle the contribution of spatial autocorrelation among sampling locations to the total variance explained by our RDA models. Two groups of soil properties were identified using discriminate analysis of principal components, with each soil property group (SPG) relating to different pedogenic processes occurring with the watershed (SPG1: organic matter-metal cycling; SPG2: base-cation cycling). Our results show there was a relatively strong correspondence between soil properties and terrain/spectral indices; with 61{\%} and 81{\%} of the total variance explained by the first four RDA axes for SPG1 and SPG2, respectively. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that both SPG1 and SPG2 were most strongly related to terrain and canopy indices; although spectral indices were also important, especially for SGP2. Variation in the types of RS indices correlated to each SPG results from variation in the degree to which each environmental covariate relates to the pedogenic process(es) driving soil property development. The approach used in this study can help improve our understanding of soil spatial variability through identifying the most significant environmental covariates related to soil variation. Given the growing demands placed upon forest ecosystems (e.g., timber, recreation, carbon sequestration), improved knowledge of soil variability and the factors that affect the soil resource is essential to facilitate more effective forest management.},

abstract = {Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modern era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future.},

@article{Paul2016,
abstract = {This review covers historical perspectives, the role of plant inputs, and the nature and dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM), often known as humus. Information on turnover of organic matter components, the role of microbial products, and modeling of SOM, and tracer research should help us to anticipate what future research may answer today's challenges. Our globe's most important natural resource is best studied relative to its chemistry, dynamics, matrix interactions, and microbial transformations. Humus has similar, worldwide characteristics, but varies with abiotic controls, soil type, vegetation inputs and composition, and the soil biota. It contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, phenol-aromatics, protein-derived and cyclic nitrogenous compounds, and some still unknown compounds. Protection of transformed plant residues and microbial products occurs through spatial inaccessibility-resource availability, aggregation of mineral and organic constituents, and interactions with sesquioxides, cations, silts, and clays. Tracers that became available in the mid-20th century made the study of SOM dynamics possible. Carbon dating identified resistant, often mineral-associated, materials to be thousands of years old, especially at depth in the profile. The 13C associated with C3C4 plant switches characterized slow turnover pools with ages ranging from dozens to hundreds of years. Added tracers, in conjunction with compound-specific product analysis and incubation, identified active pools with fast turnover rates. Physical fractionations of the intra- and inter-aggregate materials, and those associated with silt and clay, showed that all pools contain both old and young materials. Charcoal is old but not inert. The C:N ratio changes from 25 to 70:1 for plant residues to 6 to 9:1 for soil biota and microbial products associated with soil minerals. Active, slow and passive (resistant) pool concepts have been well used in biogeochemical models. The concepts discussed herein have implications for today's challenges in nutrient cycling, biogeochemistry, soil ecosystem functioning, pollution control, feeding the expanding global population and global change.},

abstract = {Mutual relationships exist between soil genesis, soil classification and soil survey. The first two subjects are dealt with separately. Some of the general lines in soil genetic investigation are traced. Next trends in soil classification are dealt with. The concepts of Knox (1965), with some additions, form the terminology of the paper. Soil classification systems are valid within certain boundary conditions. With many of the existing systems, little attention is given to this, although it is essential for judging and comparing. The method followed in compiling traditional classification systems is based on trial and error. By sampling of the universe according to the method of stratified sampling of (soil-)landscape bodies, a system suitable to soil survey can be compiled more quickly than by the method of simple random sampling. The system should be tested on the objective and by application in soil survey. The development of a system is very complex and usually takes on an iterative character. The lower and higher levels can be developed separately, but under a continual interplay. This interplay also exists with soil scientific knowledge. The lack of sharply defined and reproducible methods is striking. The broadly described numerical taxonomy is a reproducible method for parts of the process. However, this method has not yet been sufficiently tested. In spite of the precision of numerical taxonomy, a great many subjective choices have to be made. Only within the framework of these choices is this method reproducible. At the conclusion of the article, the connection between soil genesis, soil classification and soil survey is represented in a system of propositions and conclusions. These cover: (1) the connection between permanent soil characteristics, state factors of soil formation and genetic processes; (2) the existence of soil-landscape bodies; (3) the forming of a classification system from a compromise between the optimizing of classes of pedons, of soil-landscape bodies and of classes directed towards application; and (4) the recognition of delineated soil bodies on the basis of soil observations, landscape observations and the relevant theory. In the discussion, some ideas based on the relations outlined are given on soil research which is important to soil survey. ?? 1970.},

abstract = {Partitioning of soil nitrogen (N) by niche separation among species may be an important mechanism explaining species coexistence and positive biodiversity-productivity relationships in terrestrial plant communities. However, there is little experimental evidence for such partitioning, in particular, as assessed across a gradient of species richness. In experimental communities of one, three, and six temperate grassland species in the field, we tested whether increasing species richness (1) decreases niche breadths of individual species, (2) decreases niche overlap among species, and (3) increases niche breadth of whole communities. Six N sources consisting of three different chemical forms of (15)N-labeled N ((15)NO(3)(-), (15)NH(4)(+), (13)C(2)-(15)N-glycine) injected at two soil depths (3 and 12 cm) were applied to each community. The chemical form and the soil depth of N characterize the niches for which niche breadth (Levins' B) and overlap (proportional similarity) were measured. After 48 hours, aboveground plant material was harvested to measure (15)N enrichment. As expected, niche breadth of single species and niche overlap among species decreased with increased species richness, but community niche breadth did not increase. The decrease in niche breadth and niche overlap mostly occurred among subordinate species or pairs of subordinate and dominant species, rather than among dominant species. Species in the six-species mixtures mostly preferred NO(3)(-) from shallow soil. This may be partly explained by the presence of legumes in all six-species mixtures which allowed "N sparing" (i.e., increased availability of soil N since legumes rely more on atmospheric N(2) than on soil N). Niche separation with respect to N uptake from different chemical forms and soil depths did not contribute much to facilitating the coexistence of dominant species, nor do our results suggest it as a major driver of positive diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. However, partitioning of N may be important for the persistence of subordinate species.},

abstract = {Soils play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles as spatially distributed sources and sinks of nutrients. Any spatial patterns depend on soil forming processes, our understanding of which is still limited, especially in regards to tropical rainforests. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of landscape properties, with an emphasis on the geometry of the land surface, on the spatial heterogeneity of soil chemical properties, and to test the suitability of soil-landscape modeling as an appropriate technique to predict the spatial variability of exchangeable K and Mg in a humid tropical forest in Panama. We used a design-based, stratified sampling scheme to collect soil samples at 108 sites on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Stratifying variables are lithology, vegetation and topography. Topographic variables were generated from high-resolution digital elevation models with a grid size of 5 m. We took samples from five depths down to 1 m, and analyzed for total and exchangeable K and Mg. We used simple explorative data analysis techniques to elucidate the importance of lithology for soil total and exchangeable K and Mg. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were adopted to investigate importance of topography, lithology and vegetation for the spatial distribution of exchangeable K and Mg and with the intention to develop models that regionalize the point observations using digital terrain data as explanatory variables. Our results suggest that topography and vegetation do not control the spatial distribution of the selected soil chemical properties at a landscape scale and lithology is important to some degree. Exchangeable K is distributed equally across the study area indicating that other than landscape processes, e.g. biogeochemical processes, are responsible for its spatial distribution. Lithology contributes to the spatial variation of exchangeable Mg but controlling variables could not be detected. The spatial variation of soil total K and Mg is mainly influenced by lithology. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Digital elevation models were proposed and used as a data source to estimate soil properties. This study evaluated variability of texture and water retention of soils for a gently sloping 3.7-ha field located in the long-term precision farming research site at the Beltsville Ag- ricultural Research Center, MD. The specific objectives of this re- search were (i) to characterize variability of water retention across the hillslope, and (ii) determine and describe any correlations of soil water retention with soil texture and surface topography. Soil was sampled along four 30-m transects and in 39 points within the study area. Textural fraction contents, bulk density, and water retention at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 33, 100, 500, and 1500 kPa were measured in samples taken from 4- to 10-cm depth.A30-m digital elevation model (DEM) was constructed from aerial photography data. Slopes, profile curva- tures, and tangential curvatures were computed in grid nodes and interpolated to the sampling locations. Regressions with spatially cor- related errors were used to relate water retention and texture to computed topographic variables. Sand, silt, and clay contents de- pended on slope and curvatures. Soil water retention at 10 and 33 kPa correlated with sand and silt contents. The regression model relating water retention to the topographic variables explained more than 60{\%} of variation in soil water content at 10 and 33 kPa, and only 20{\%}of variation at 100 kPa. Increases in slope values and decreases in tangential curvature values, i.e., less concavity or more convexity across the slope, led to the decreases in water retention at 10 and 33 kPa. Results of this work show a potential for topographic variables to be used in interpretation of field-scale variability of soil properties and, possibly, yield maps in precision agriculture.},

Little is known about spatial heterogeneity patterns of soil properties in tropical forest soils. Soil was moderately acidic pH 5.28) with low concentrations of exchangeable base cations (13.4 cmol(c)/kg), Bray-extractable PO4 (2.2 mg/kg), KCl-extractable NO3 (5.0 mg/kg), and KCl-extractable NH4 (15.5 mg/kg). The coefficient of variation for soil properties ranged from 24{\%} to {\textgreater}200{\%}, with a median value of 84{\%}. Geostatistical analysis revealed spatial dependence at a scale of 10-100m for most of the soil properties; however, pH, NH4, Al, and B had spatial dependence at a scale up to 350 m. Best-fit models to individual variograms included random, exponential, spherical, Gaussian, linear, and power functions, indicating many different spatial patterns among the set of soil properties. Correlation among individual elements was poor, indicating independent patterns. Our results show complex spatial patterns in soil chemical properties and provide a basis for future investigations on soil-plant relationships and soil nutrient niche differentiation.},

abstract = {ggplot2 is one of the most sophisticated and advanced packages of R and its use is constantly growing in the community of R programmers. This book is the perfect starting point for your journey in learning about one of the most refined and widely used plotting tools—ggplot2.You will start by taking a tour of the most relevant packages available in R to create plots, such as graphics, lattice, and ggplot2. Following this, you will take a deep dive into the concepts of ggplot2 by covering different kinds of plots that will help you gear up for your first hands-on project. After this first taste of the capabilities of ggplot2, you will explore in detail the visualization approach implemented in this package, the so-called grammar of graphics, providing you with the basics to understand the backstage concepts in the plotting functions. Finally, you will take a look at some specialized and sophisticated applications of ggplot2, such as how to realize a complex scatterplot matrix, heatmaps, and how to make spatial visualization graphs.},

abstract = {We review historical soil maps from a geographical perspective, in contrast to the more traditional temporal-historical perspective. Our geographical approach examines and compares soil maps based on their scale and classification system. To analyze the connection between scale in historical soil maps and their associated classification systems, we place soil maps into three categories of cartographic scale. We then examine how categories of cartographic scale correspond to the selection of environmental soil predictors used to initially create the maps, as reflected by the maps' legend. Previous analyses of soil mapping from the temporal perspective have concluded that soil classification systems have co-evolved with gains in soil knowledge. We conclude that paradigm shifts in soil mapping and classification can be better explained by not only their correlation to historical improvements in scientific understanding, but also by differences in purpose for mapping, and due to advancements in geographic technology. We observe that, throughout history, small cartographic scale maps have tended to emphasize climate-vegetation zonation. Medium cartographic scale maps have put more emphasis on parent material as a variable to explain soil distributions. And finally, soil maps at large cartographic scales have relied more on topography as a predictive factor. Importantly, a key characteristic of modern soil classification systems is their multi-scale approach, which incorporates these phenomena scales within their classification hierarchies. Although most modern soil classification systems are based on soil properties, the soil map remains a model, the purpose of which is to predict the spatial distributions of those properties. Hence, multi-scale classification systems still tend to be organized, at least in part, by this observed spatial hierarchy. Although the hierarchy observed in this study is generally known in pedology today, it also represents a new view on the evolution of soil science. Increased recognition of this hierarchy may also help to more holistically combine soil formation factors with soil geography and pattern, particularly in the context of digital soil mapping.},

abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi- species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others. Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example 'sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified frame- work needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differ- ences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded tbat they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

abstract = {A critical summary of count data is its mean-variance relationship, yet this is rarely considered in multivariate analysis in ecology. This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean-variance relationship in distance-based analyses - multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances - and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean-variance relationship. It is known that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. Potential consequences of this mean-variance misspecifiation are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. Data transformation does not solve the problem. A solution is to use generalized linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

abstract = {1. The subordinate insurance hypothesis suggests that highly diverse communities contain greater numbers of subordinate species than less diverse communities. It has previously been reported that subordinate species can improve grassland productivity during drought, but the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. 2. Using a combination of subordinate species removal and summer drought, we show that soil processes play a critical role in community resistance to drought. Interestingly, subordinate species drive soil microbial community structure and largely mitigate the effect of drought on grassland soil functioning. Our results highlight subordinate species in shifting the balance within the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) microbial community towards more fungal dominance. 3. Fungal communities promoted by subordinate species were more resistant to drought and maintained higher rates of litter decomposition and soil respiration. These results emphasize the important role of subordinate species in mitigating drought effects on soil ecosystem func- tions. Reciprocal effects between fungi and subordinate species explain also how subordinate species better resisted to drought conditions. 4. Our results point to a delayed plant–soil feedback following environmental perturbation. Additionally, they extend the diversity insurance hypothesis by showing that more diverse communities not only contain species well adapted to perturbations, but also species with higher impacts on soil microbial communities and related ecosystem functions.},

@article{Franklin2013,
abstract = {In view of the rapid loss of biodiversity, large-scale environmental monitoring programs are urgently needed, over a range of local, regional and global scales. These programs can be made more efficient and cost-effective through shortcuts such as reduction of sampling effort and the use of low-cost surrogates. We revisited a large-scale dataset composed by 161 species recorded in 72 plots of 250 m, distributed over an 8 m × 8 m sampling grid in the tropical rainforest. Samples of litter and soil were collected and oribatid mites were extracted with a Berlese-Tullgren apparatus. Using a "moving window" procedure, we delimited smaller 5 km × 5 km grids in 16 possible positions within the larger grid. We first evaluated which fraction was more important to explain environmental and spatial patterns in the species composition: known environmental or spatial filters representing unknown causes of aggregation, and the confounded variance that might be associated with either or both. We used soil clay content, litter quantity, soil pH, number of trees, and distance to the nearest stream as environmental predictors. The spatial filters were generated using Moran Eigenvector mapping through the Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices technique. To evaluate the influence of these fractions on the species composition, we used partial Redundancy Analysis. Using Principal Coordinates Analysis for abundance and presence/absence data, we evaluated if reduced matrices, discarding sets of less-frequent species, could identify the relationships captured with the complete dataset. All smaller grids contained more than 100 species. The effect of environmental variables on oribatid-mite community composition was always low, and each smaller grid position produced different results. Soil clay content and pH were the main factors associated with oribatid-mite distributions. The effects of unknown spatial patterns were greater than the environmental ones. Independently of the grid position, similar results were obtained for analyses with all oribatid-mite species, to the results obtained from analyses of only the most frequent species. Sets of more frequent and easily identifiable species proved to be a reliable surrogate for the complete assemblage. Omitting identifications of most species will improve the cost-effectiveness of monitoring programs. More emphasis should be placed on investigating the role of spatial heterogeneity and the effects of grid position in relation to patterns in species associations. Efficient biomonitoring could target surrogate species, to enable rapid tracking of environmental change while enlarging the sampling area to provide data for conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The contribution of common species to overall species richness in many cases is greater than that of rare species. However, the explanation of this phenomenon remains vague. One hypothesis is that this is a sampling issue and not a biological one. Therefore standardization methods like the information index and empirical variance have been proposed. But, these standardizations do not explicitly compare the significance of the dataset size of the common and rare sub-assemblage. Here, we investigate the role of dataset size in accounting for the capacity of common and rare species to contribute to diversity spatial patterns. We used a dataset of 5148 vascular plant species recorded in 16,439 sample plots in the Greek Natura 2000 network. Species were ranked according to the number of sample plots they occupied in ascending (rare to common), descending (common to rare) and random order. We analyzed the correlation between the richness of each sub-assemblage and total species richness. When comparing among sub-assemblages with equal number of species, common species are clearly the better predictors of total species richness. But, when comparing among sub-assemblages with equal number of occurrence records, the patterns changed. Common and rare species contribution to the overall richness pattern was comparable, with rare species contributing slightly less than widespread species in some cases and the opposite in other cases. However in all cases, sub-assemblages of random species remarkably outperformed the equal sized sub-assemblages of common or rare species. Our results suggest that common and rare species are biased samples of the community and that equal sized random samples are more representative; thus the greater contribution of common species than rare species to biodiversity patterns might be more a sampling issue than a biological effect of commonness or rarity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The word acquisition emphasizes that more is involved in getting inorganic nutrients into plants than ion transport across cell membranes.The present review is concerned with two interfaces; much of the subject matter relates to events occurring at OI very near the root/soil interface, and the review itself attempts to provide an interface between plant physiology and soil science. Even at the risk of having rocks thrown from both sides, I suggest that many of the intriguing processes that occur in the root/soil interface merit a more purposeful and integrated investigation, especially by plant physiolo­ gists, than they have received. From a vast amount of published work I have been very selective in choosing matters that raise interesting physiological questions. I have not dealt with dinitrogen fixation by nodule-forming organ­ isms or by free-living N-fixing microorganisms since these vigorous fields are frequently reviewed; neither have I attempted to detail the various influences of environment on nutrient acquisition. The discussion opens with results of mathematical modeling which suggest the relative importance of root prop­ erties in nutrient acquisition; the more important properties are then examined. It is widely known that many plants are unable to acquire enough phosphorus from unfertilized soils or to forage effectively for other nutrients without the assistance of mycorrhizas. The discussion here deals with the nutrient ex­ changes between host and fungus in vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (V AM) and the energetic "cost" of maintaining the association. Growth is the pacemak­ er for nutricnt inflow to the plant, and this inflow can be regulated by varying the relative size of the absorbing system or the capacity of its uptake mechan­ isms. There is considerable diversity in the way that different types of plants manage their affairs when confronted by growth-limiting supplies of mineral nutrients (29). The last major section of this chapter concerns the consumption of energy in nutrient acquisition. In summary, this review asks what factors are of the greatest importance in nutrient acquisition, how is it regulated, and what does it cost?},

abstract = {The soil supports plants, is the physical determinant of root growth and extent, and is the main reservoir for plant-available water and nutrients. Therefore, the soil controls the availability of most essential plant nutrients. It regulates availability by means of biophysiochemical processes, which are functions of soil and plant properties. This chapter introduces the concept of soil nutrient bioavailability, and the soil factors that regulate it. It summarizes the processes that control nutrient release and movement in the soil, and points out the importance of selected plant root characteristics in nutrient acquisition. The soil–plant system's capacity to supply/absorb nutrients is termed soil nutrient bioavailability, and is the ability of the soil–plant system to supply essential plant nutrients to a target plant, or plant association, during a specific period of time as a result of the processes controlling (1) the release of nutrients from their solid phase in the soil to their solution phase; (2) the movement of nutrients through the soil solution to the plant root–mycorrhizae; and (3) the absorption of nutrients by the plant root–mycorrhizal system (Comerford 1998). Release of nutrients from the solid phase to the soil solution is controlled by the physiochemical processes of desorption and dissolution. It is also a biochemical process by way of mineralization. In both cases, soil and plant root–mycorrhizal characteristics help regulate the expression and dominance of these processes (Table 1.1). The movement of nutrients through the soil solution to the root–mycorrhizal surface is determined by mass flow and diffusion, which in turn are controlled by the interaction of soil and plant characteristics (Table 1.1). Finally, nutrient uptake at the root surface is dependent on the amount of root–mycorrhizal surface and its uptake characteristics. The following discussion presents the three groups of processes outlined above. It concentrates on delimiting those soil characteristics important to defining nutrient bioavailability.},

abstract = {A variety of landscape properties have been modeled successfully using topographic indices such as topographic wetness index (TWI), defined as ln(a/tan$\beta$), where a is the specific upslope area and $\beta$ is the surface slope. In this study, 25 m spatial resolution from digital elevation models (DEM) data were used to investigate the scale-dependency of TWI values when converting DEMs to 50 and 100 m. To investigate the impact of different spatial resolution, the two lower resolution DEMs were interpolated to the original 25 m grid size. In addition, to compare different flow-direction algorithms, a second objective was to evaluate differences in spatial patterns. Thus the values of TWI were compared in two different ways: 1) distribution functions and their statistics; and 2) cell by cell comparison of DEMs with the same spatial resolution but different flow- directions. As in previous TWI studies, the computed specific upstream is smaller, on average, at higher resolution. TWI variation decreased with increasing grid size. A cell by cell comparison of the TWI values of the 50 and 100 m DEMs showed a low correlation with the TWI based on the 25 m DEM. The results showed significant differences between different flow-diretction algorithms computed for DEMs with 25, 50 and 100 m spatial resolution.},

@article{Sæther2000,
abstract = {We investigated the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in whole fish and gut samples of several species of cyprinids, relating our findings to nutrient flux models. Some differences in whole-fish nutrient content across species, lakes, and seasons, as well as differences across fish length and mass, were found. N and P contents were highest in fathead minnows and lowest in pearl dace, with northern redbelly dace and finescale dace intermediate. Larger fish had higher percent C and lower percent N and P. However, all differences in whole fish C, N, and P chemistry were small. Cyprinids had the following mean composition: carbon, 46{\%}; nitrogen, 9.7{\%}; and phosphorus, 1.5{\%}. The cyprinid molar C:N:P ratio was 242:16:1. These values make cyprinids relatively low in phosphorus compared to other fish that have been previously studied, especially members of the Percidae and Centrarchidae. Gut contents were lower in N and P than the whole fish, and C:N and C:P ratios were correspondingly higher in gut contents than in the whole fish. Thus, minnows must concentrate both of these nutrients within their biomass compared to what they eat. The N:P ratio of minnows and minnow gut contents had nearly identical means. All chemical variables showed lower variation in the fish than in the gut contents, supporting a homeostatic model of nutrient flux. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis found that minnows were similar to 3 parts per thousand (parts per thousand) heavier than their gut contents, providing evidence that gut contents analyzed were derived mainly from ingested material. A homeostatic nutrient model appears to be an appropriate one for fish.},

abstract = {The topographic wetness index (TWI, ln(a/tan )), which combines local upslope contributing area and slope, is commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes. Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.},

abstract = {Following the first two chapters in which the importance of dispersal mechanisms and the general terminology in use are briefly but adequately discussed, there are two chapters dealing with the various morphological adaptations of plants which aid dispersal. The bulk of the book deals with the role played by invertebrates, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals as dispersal agents and also the importance of wind and water. Examples of the various mechanisms involved have obviously been chosen with care and give some fascinating and relevant facts concerning both plants and animals. In a section on the evolution of dispersal organs the theories of a number of authors are reviewed and discussed. Starting with the pteridophytes, the changes in the functions of spores, seeds and fruits are presented in such a way as to give a comprehensive and enlightening account of the evolutionary pathways involved. The text is illustrated by some excellent photographs and diagrams although, in some cases, the labelling of the diagrams is somewhat confusing. It is unfortunate that the English style throughout the book does not make for easy reading, but for the reader who is prepared to battle with this there lies a wealth of interesting and scientifically sound information.},

abstract = {1. We investigated the relationships of seed size, dispersal mode and other species characteristics to interspecific variation in mean primary seed dispersal distances, mean annual seed production per unit basal area, and clumping of seed deposition among 41 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. 2. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating interannual variation in seed production was used to estimate seed dispersal, seed production, and clumping of seed rain for each species from 19 years of data for 188 seed traps on a 50-ha plot in which all adult trees were censused every 5 years. 3. Seed dispersal was modelled as a two-dimensional Student's T distribution with the degrees of freedom parameter fixed at 3, interannual variation in seed production per basal area was modelled as a lognormal, and the clumping of seed rain around its expected value was modelled as a negative binomial distribution. 4. There was wide variation in seed dispersal distances among species sharing the same mode of seed dispersal. Seed dispersal mode did not explain significant variation in seed dispersal distances, but did explain significant variation in clumping: animal-dispersed species showed higher clumping of seed deposition. 5. Among nine wind-dispersed species, the combination of diaspore terminal velocity, tree height and wind speed in the season of peak dispersal explained 40{\%} of variation in dispersal distances. Among 31 animal-dispersed species, 20{\%} of interspecific variation in dispersal distances was explained by seed mass (a negative effect) and tree height (a positive effect). 6. Among all species, seed mass, tree height and dispersal syndrome explained 28{\%} of the variation in mean dispersal distance and seed mass alone explained 45{\%} of the variation in estimated seed production per basal area. 7. Synthesis . There is wide variation in patterns of primary seed rain among tropical tree species. Substantial proportions of interspecific variation in seed production, seed dispersal distances, and clumping of seed deposition are explained by relatively easily measured plant traits, especially dispersal mode, seed mass, and tree height. This provides hope for trait-based generalization and modelling of seed dispersal in tropical forests.},

abstract = {1. Nutrients are a critical resource for plant growth, but the elements limiting growth in tropical forests have rarely been determined. 2. We investigated the influence of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and micronutrients on seedling biomass and nutrient allocation in a factorial nutrient fertilization experiment in lowland tropical forest at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We also measured 8 years of herbivory and growth for 1800 seedlings. We sought to determine the identity of limiting elements and possible nutrient interactions. 3. The five study species were Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis and Tetragastris panamensis. Plants grew in deeply shaded understorey with a mean canopy openness of 4.9{\%} (±0.7{\%}; 1 SE). 4. Tissue N concentration increased by 11{\%} with N addition. Tissue P concentration increased by 16{\%} with P addition. Tissue K increased by 4{\%} with K addition. K addition reduced root-to-shoot biomass ratio. There was no significant effect of fertilization on specific leaf area or leaf area ratio. 5. The proportion of leaves damaged and the mean level of damage by herbivory increased with P and K addition and showed a significant P × K interaction. 6.7ensp;Across all species and years, relative growth rate of height increased with K addition and with N and P in combination. Relative growth rate of leaf count trended 8.5{\%} higher with K addition (P = 0.076). 7. We also added micronutrients in a parallel experiment. There was no effect of micronutrient addition on any seedling parameter. 8. Synthesis. K addition affected seedlings by enhancing tissue nutrient concentration, increasing herbivory, reducing root-to-shoot biomass ratio and increasing height growth. Additional effects of N or P on tissue chemistry, herbivory and growth offer support for the multiple limiting resources hypothesis. Our results suggest that seedling growth is limited by nutrients, especially K, even under highly shaded conditions in this lowland tropical forest.},

Geostatistical analysis revealed spatial dependence at a scale of 10-100m for most of the soil properties; however, pH, NH4, Al, and B had spatial dependence at a scale up to 350 m. Best-fit models to individual variograms included random, exponential, spherical, Gaussian, linear, and power functions, indicating many different spatial patterns among the set of soil properties.

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

A long- standing goal of biogeographers has been to understand the primary factors that generate and maintain high diversity in the tropics. Many ‘historical' and ‘ecolog- ical' hypotheses have been proposed and debated, but there is still little consen- sus. Recent discussions have centred around two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play important roles, but accumulating theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot'.},

abstract = {Analyses of functional traits have become fundamental tools for understanding patterns and processes in plant community ecology. In this context, regenerative seed traits play an important, yet overlooked, role because they largely determine the ability of plants to disperse and re-establish. A survey of recent publications in community ecology suggests that seed germination traits in particular are neglected at the expense of other relevant but overused traits based only on seed morphology. As a response to this bias, we discuss the functional significance of seed germination traits in comparison with morphological and biophysical seed traits, and advocate their use in vegetation science. We also demonstrate how research in community assembly, climate change and restoration ecology can benefit from the inclusion of germination traits, encompassing functions that cannot be explained solely by adult plant traits. Seed germination experiments conducted in the laboratory or field to quantify these traits provide ecologically meaningful and relatively easy-to-obtain information about the functional properties of plant communities. We argue that bridging the gap between seed physiologists and community ecologists will improve the prediction of plant assemblages, and propose further perspectives for including seed traits into the research agenda of functional community ecologists.},

@article{Lamanna2014,
abstract = {The processes causing the latitudinal gradient in species richness remain elusive. Ecological theories for the origin of biodiversity gradients, such as competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics, and environmental filtering, make predictions for how functional diversity should vary at the alpha (within local assemblages), beta (among assemblages), and gamma (regional pool) scales. We test these predictions by quantifying hypervolumes constructed from functional traits representing major axes of plant strategy variation (specific leaf area, plant height, and seed mass) in tree assemblages spanning the temperate and tropical New World. Alpha-scale trait volume decreases with absolute latitude and is often lower than sampling expectation, consistent with environmental filtering theory. Beta-scale overlap decays with geographic distance fastest in the temperate zone, again consistent with environmental filtering theory. In contrast, gamma-scale trait space shows a hump-shaped relationship with absolute latitude, consistent with no theory. Furthermore, the overall temperate trait hypervolume was larger than the overall tropical hypervolume, indicating that the temperate zone permits a wider range of trait combinations or that niche packing is stronger in the tropical zone. Although there are limitations in the data, our analyses suggest that multiple processes have shaped trait diversity in trees, reflecting no consistent support for any one theory.},

abstract = {Interspecific differences in relative fitness can cause local dominance by a single species. However, stabilizing interspecific niche differences can promote local diversity. Understanding these mechanisms requires that we simultaneously quantify their effects on demography and link these effects to community dynamics. Successional forests are ideal systems for testing assembly theory because they exhibit rapid community assembly. Here, we leverage functional trait and long-term demographic data to build spatially explicit models of successional community dynamics of lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. First, we ask what the effects and relative importance of four trait-mediated community assembly processes are on tree survival, a major component of fitness. We model trait correlations with relative fitness differences that are both density-independent and -dependent in addition to trait correlations with stabilizing niche differences. Second, we ask how the relative importance of these trait-mediated processes relates to successional changes in functional diversity. Tree dynamics were more strongly influenced by trait-related interspecific variation in average survival than trait-related responses to neighbors, with wood specific gravity (WSG) positively correlated with greater survival. Our findings also suggest that competition was mediated by stabilizing niche differences associated with specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). These drivers of individual-level survival were reflected in successional shifts to higher SLA and LDMC diversity but lower WSG diversity. Our study makes significant advances to identifying the links between individual tree performance, species functional traits, and mechanisms of tropical forest succession.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of plant species are determined by an array of ecological factors including biotic and abiotic environmental constraints and intrinsic species traits. Thus, an observed aggregated pattern may be the result of short-distance dispersal, the presence of habitat heterogeneity, plant-plant interactions or a combination of the above. Here, we studied the spatial pattern of Mediterranean alpine plant Silene ciliata Poiret (Caryophyllaceae) in five populations and assessed the contribution of dispersal, habitat heterogeneity and conspecific plant interactions to observed patterns. For this purpose, we used spatial point pattern analysis combined with specific a priori hypotheses linked to spatial pattern creation. The spatial pattern of S. ciliata recruits was not homogeneous and showed small-scale aggregation. This is consistent with the species' short-distance seed dispersal and the heterogeneous distribution of suitable sites for germination and establishment. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of recruits was independent of the spatial pattern of adults. This suggests a low relevance of adult-recruits interactions in the spatial pattern creation. The difference in aggregation between recruits and adults suggests that once established, recruits are subjected to self-thinning. However, seedling mortality did not erase the spatial pattern generated by seed dispersal, as S. ciliata adults were still aggregated. Thus, the spatial aggregation of adults is probably due to seed dispersal limitation and the heterogeneous distribution of suitable sites at seedling establishment rather than the presence of positive plant-plant interactions at the adult stage. In fact, a negative density-dependent effect of the conspecific neighbourhood was found on adult reproductive performance. Overall, results provide empirical evidence of the lack of a simple and direct relationship between the spatial structure of plant populations and the sign of plant-plant interactions and outline the importance of considering dispersal and habitat heterogeneity when performing spatial analysis assessments.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Understanding which factors and rules govern the process of assembly in communities constitutes one of the main challenges of plant community ecology. The presence of certain functional strategies along broad environmental gradients can help to understand the patterns observed in community assembly and the filtering mechanisms that take place. We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in aboveground (leaf and stem) and belowground (root) functional traits along environmental gradients in Mediterranean forest communities (south Spain). We proposed a new practical method to quantify the relative importance of species turnover (distinguishing between species occurrence and abundance) versus intraspecific variation, which allowed us to better understand the assemblage rules of these plant communities along environmental gradients. Our results showed that the functional structure of the studied plant communities was highly determined by soil environment. Results from our modelling approach based on maximum likelihood estimators showed a predominant influence of soil water storage on most of the community functional traits. We found that changes in community functional structure along environmental gradients were mainly promoted by species turnover rather than by intraspecific variability. Specifically, our new method of variance decomposition demonstrated that between-site trait variation was the result of changes in species occurrence rather than in the abundance of certain dominant species. In conclusion, this study showed that water availability promoted the predominance of specific trait values (both in above and belowground fractions) associated to a resource acquisition or conservation strategy. In addition, we provided evidence that changes on community functional structure along the environmental gradient were mainly promoted by a process of species replacement, which represent a crucial step towards a more general understanding of the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific trait variation in these woody Mediterranean communities.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) have become a fertile area of research interest at the confluence of spatial ecology and GIScience and have been used to study a wide range of biogeographical phenomena, including invasive species, vector-borne diseases, and biological diversity. Scale is one of the most important considerations in any spatial analysis study because different spatial patterns emerge at different scales. An issue related to the ‘extent' concept of scale that has more recently been recognized as important is spatial nonstationarity, which exists when processes or models of processes vary across space. This research examined the scale of species–environment relationships by a relatively new (in SDM) statistical method, geographically weighted regression (GWR). We tested four different types of species and 10 different types of environmental (climate and topography) variables in univariate GWR models to explore how stationarity and explanatory power varied with scale (as a function of GWR bandwidth size). The results suggest that the scale of species–environment relationships varies for both different types of species and different types of environmental variables. The two metrics used here – stationarity index and explained variance – did not show congruity in terms of a ‘characteristic scale.' Species' relationships with climate and elevation variables became stationary at broader scales, and in some cases the models did not become stationary at the largest bandwidth tested. The complex topographic variables used here operate at finer scales and were often stationary across all scales or became stationary at small bandwidths. In addition to being instrumental for examining the effects of scale on spatial nonstationarity and a model's explanatory ability, GWR can also be used to explore potential geographical factors that result in nonstationarity.},

abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

After such incorporation, a reduction apparently occurred in the predictive power of the environmental variables, especially those with an inherently high amount of SAC. For example, Mg2+ was the most significant predictor for species diversity in OLS, but it became insignificant in spatial regression. This indicates that, during the incorporation of SAC, the predictive importance of Mg2+ was replaced by that of spatial filters. In other words, because the SAC of Mg2+ was inherently strong (global Moran's I = 0.68, p},

abstract = {* Climate change is likely to shift plant communities towards species from warmer regions, a process termed ‘thermophilization'. In forests, canopy disturbances such as fire may hasten this process by increasing temperature and moisture stress in the understory, yet little is known about the mechanisms that might drive such shifts, or the consequences of these processes for plant diversity. * We sampled understory vegetation across a gradient of disturbance severity from a large-scale natural experiment created by the factorial combination of forest thinning and wildfire in California. Using information on evolutionary history and functional traits, we tested the hypothesis that disturbance severity should increase community dominance by species with southern-xeric biogeographic affinities. We also analysed how climatic productivity mediates the effect of disturbance severity, and quantified the functional trait response to disturbance, to investigate potential mechanisms behind thermophilization. * The proportion of north-temperate flora decreased, while the proportion of southern-xeric flora increased, with greater disturbance severity and less canopy closure. Disturbance caused a greater reduction of north-temperate flora in productive (wetter) forests, while functional trait analyses suggested that species colonizing after severe disturbance may be adapted to increased water stress. Forests with intermediate disturbance severity, where abundances of northern and southern species were most equitable, had the highest stand-scale understory diversity. * Synthesis. Canopy disturbance is likely to accelerate plant community shifts towards species from warmer regions, via its effects on understory microclimate at small scales. Understory diversity can be enhanced by intermediate disturbance regimes that promote the coexistence of species with different biogeographic affinities.},

abstract = {In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of commu- nity data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and effi- ciency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model- based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first exam- ple, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

abstract = {Facilitation is an important driver of community assembly, and often overwhelms the effect of competition in stressed habitats. Thus, net effect of biotic interactions is often positive in stressed grasslands, where dominant species and litter can protect the subordinate species. Besides facilitation, niche partitioning can also support species coexistence leading to limiting similarity between subordinate species. Our aim was to provide a detailed analysis of fine-scale biotic interactions in stressed alkali grasslands. We supposed, that there are positive relationships between the main biomass fractions and species richness. We expected the expansion of trait ranges and the increase of trait dissimilarity with increasing biomass scores (total litter, green biomass of dominant species) and species richness. We studied the relationships between main biomass fractions, species richness, functional diversity and functional trait indices (ranges, weighted means and Rao indices). We used fine-scale biomass sampling in nine stands of dry alkali grasslands dominated by Festuca pseudovina. The detected relationships were always positive between the main biomass fractions (green biomass of dominant species, total litter and green biomass of subordinate species) and species richness. We found that the green biomass of dominant species and total litter increased ranges and dissimilarity of functional traits. Our results suggest that in dry alkali grasslands facilitation is crucial in shaping vegetation composition. The green biomass of dominant species and total litter increased the biomass production of subordinate species leading to overyielding. We found that mechanisms of facilitation and limiting similarity were jointly shaping the species coexistence in stressed grasslands, such as alkali grasslands.},

This promise is a major reason for the increased popularity of this approach. Here, we argue that some important foundational assumptions of trait-based ecology have not received sufficient empirical evaluation. We identify three such assumptions and, where possible, suggest methods of improvement: (i) traits are functional to the degree that they determine individual fitness, (ii) intraspecific variation in functional traits can be largely ignored, and (iii) functional traits show general predictive relationships to measurable environmental gradients .},

abstract = {1. Traditionally, techniques of plant manipulation during restoration have focused on the reduction of competition by 'problematic' existing vegetation. However, the increasing recognition of facilitation as a main process regulating the composition of communities has brought a change in the practice of restoration towards a better awareness of the benefits inherent to conserving neighbouring vegetation. 2. Here, I provide the results of a meta-analysis of published studies that have manipulated interactions among plants with the objective of restoring degraded terrestrial systems. I created four different data sets corresponding to the variables most commonly used to measure plant performance (i.e. emergence, survival, growth and density), and asked whether the benefits of facilitation as a restoration tool vary depending on the study duration, the life-form of the neighbour and target species, and the ecosystem type. 3. Neighbour effects varied strongly among performance estimators. Positive effects were frequently found for emergence and survival, whereas neutral or negative interactions predominated for growth and density. 4. No clear support existed for a relationship between study duration and neighbour effect. 5. The life-form of the interacting species, particularly of neighbours, largely influenced the interaction outcome. Herbs had strong negative effects, especially on other herb species, whereas shrubs had large facilitative effects, especially on trees. 6. Semiarid and tropical systems showed in general more positive neighbour effects than wetlands and particularly mesic temperate systems, where negative interactions predominated. However, these results were largely influenced by the over-representation of herb species in wetlands and temperate habitats, survival facilitation being found in all systems when only woody species were considered. 7. Synthesis. Pre-existing vegetation can have large impacts on species establishment in degraded habitats. Inhibition predominates in herbaceous communities typical of early-successional stages, whereas facilitation prevailes in communities dominated by shrubs and trees. Even productive systems (e.g. mesic temperate habitats) appear suitable for the application of facilitation as a restoration tool of woody communities. Whereas restoring herbaceous communities seems largely reliable on removal techniques, augmenting populations of nurse shrubs and trees should be considered a promising strategy for re{\ldots}},

abstract = {A humped-back relationship between species richness and community biomass has frequently been observed in plant communities, at both local and regional scales, although often improperly called a productivity-diversity relationship. Explanations for this relationship have emphasized the role of competitive exclusion, probably because at the time when the relationship was first examined, competition was considered to be the significant biotic filter structuring plant communities. However, over the last 15 years there has been a renewed interest in facilitation and this research has shown a clear link between the role of facilitation in structuring communities and both community biomass and the severity of the environment. Although facilitation may enlarge the realized niche of species and increase community richness in stressful environments, there has only been one previous attempt to revisit the humped-back model of species richness and to include facilitative processes. However, to date, no model has explored whether biotic interactions can potentially shape both sides of the humped-back model for species richness commonly detected in plant communities. Here, we propose a revision of Grime's original model that incorporates a new understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. In this revised model, facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels, by expanding the realized niche of stress-intolerant competitive species into harsh physical conditions. However, when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive effects of the benefactors wane (as supported by recent research on facilitative interactions in extremely severe environments) and diversity is reduced. Conversely, with decreasing stress along the biomass gradient, facilitation decreases because stress-intolerant species become able to exist away from the canopy of the stress-tolerant species (as proposed by facilitation theory). At the same time competition increases for stress-tolerant species, reducing diversity in the most benign conditions (as proposed by models of competition theory). In this way our inclusion of facilitation into the classic model of plant species diversity and community biomass generates a more powerful and richer predictive framework for understanding the role of plant interactions in changing diversity. We then use our revised model to explain both the observed discrepancies between natural pa{\ldots}},

Do forest patches of different sizes differ in woody plant colonization patterns'? Location: Sao Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 29 degrees 28' S, 50 degrees 13' W. Methods: Three woody vegetation types, differing in structural development (patch size) and recovering for 10 years from cattle and burning disturbances, were sampled on grassland. We analysed the composition and complexity of the woody sapling communities, through relative abundance, richness and diversity patterns. We also evaluated recruitment status (residents vs. colonizers) of species in communities occurring, in different forest patch size classes. Results: 1. There is a compositional gradient in sapling communities strongly associated with forest patch area. 2. Richness and diversity are positively correlated to patch area, but Only in poorly structured patches; large patches present richness and diversity values similar to small patches. 3. Resident to colonizer abundance ratio increases from nurse plants to large patches. The species number proportion between residents and colonizers is similar in small and large patches and did not differ between these patch types. 4. Large patches presented a high number of exclusive species, while nurse plants and small patches did not. Conclusions: Woody plant communities in Araucaria forest patches are associated with patch structure development. Richness and diversity patterns are linked to patch colonization patterns. Generalist species colonize the understorey of nurse plants and small patches; resident species cannot recruit many new individuals. In large patches, sapling recruitment by resident adults precludes the immigration of new species into the patches, limiting richness and diversity.},

abstract = {Restoration of degraded swamps often requires strong human intervention because of their fragility. In Brazil, coastal swamp forests are now much reduced by anthropogenic action. This paper investigates survival and growth performance of nine native shrub and tree species introduced into a degraded swamp invaded by exotic grasses and sedges in coastal Rio de Janeiro. Our central aim was to evaluate which species were more appropriate for use in initial stages of revegetation. Additionally, in separate field experiments, we tested statistical hypotheses that higher survival and growth performance would be found for seedlings: (a) taller in height, (b) subjected to shorter duration of flooding, and (c) planted with addition of organic matter inside the planting holes. Results were analyzed after 3 years of planting. "Planting in mounds", and a consequent reduction on the flooding period plants are exposed to, increased survival and growth. The use of taller seedlings often increased survival, and organic matter addition increased growth. Three (Myrsine rubra, Tabebuia cassinoides, and Calyptranthes brasiliensis) out of nine species tested showed high growth- and use-viability indices, and were therefore indicated for use in revegetation programs. Interspecific variation as regards responses to the treatments applied suggests that in the future, species evaluated for this purpose, should be examined on a case-by-case basis.},

abstract = {Abstract The highest concentration of oak species in the world occurs in Mexico, but human activities have strongly degraded these oak forests. Mexican oaks have high economic, social, and cultural value, and restoring these forests is of paramount importance for the people of Mexico. Here, we propose a method for restoring oak forests using native shrubs that colonize degraded areas as nurse plants for oak seedlings. To test the viability of this proposal, seedling transplant experiments were performed in a degraded area near a protected oak forest relict. Two pioneer shrubs were identified as potential nurse species: Mimosa luisana and Senecio sp. The target oak species was Quercus castanea. Oak seedlings were located beneath the canopies of both shrubs and in the surrounding area without shrub cover. Water is a limiting resource for oak establishment in seasonally dry environments; therefore, we included irrigation systems in our experimental design to determine whether the combination of nurse plants plus watering led to higher rate of survival than the presence of nurse species alone. Seedling survival without watering was less than 20{\%} both beneath nurse species and in the surrounding habitat. When water was supplied, survival rate beneath nurse species increased up to 58{\%} while survival in the surrounding habitat did not differ from that observed in treatments without watering. Our results indicate that survival rate of oak seedlings is increased by the presence of nurse plants only when water is supplied. This suggests that restoration of oak forests in these degraded areas requires both nurse plants and watering.},

abstract = {The nurse-plant syndrome (see Franco and Nobel 1989) takes place when plant species shelter seedlings, young and/or adult individuals of other species through their ontogeny. The nurse-plant might then enhance fitness, survival and/or growth of associated species (Callaway et al. 2002; Bruno et al. 2003). However, positive and negative interactions are unlikely to occur separately in nature (Holmgren et al. 1997; Brooker and Callaghan 1998; Dickie et al. 2005). This balance is affected by spatial and temporal shifts (Morris and Wood 1989; Tielb{\"{o}}rger and Kadmon 1997; Callaway 1998) related to plant ontogenetic development and/or changes in resource availability (Callaway and Walker 1997).

abstract = {Restoration and preservation of coastal dunes is urgently needed because of the increasingly rapid loss and degradation of these ecosystems because of many human activities. These activities alter natural processes and coastal dynamics, eliminate topographic variability, fragment, degrade or eliminate habitats, reduce diversity and threaten endemic species. The actions of coastal dune restoration that are already taking place span contrasting activities that range from revegetating and stabilizing the mobile substrate, to removing plant cover and increasing substrate mobility. Our goal was to review how the relative progress of the actions of coastal dune restoration has been assessed, according to the ecosystem attributes outlined by the Society of Ecological Restoration: namely, integrity, health and sustainability and that are derived from the ecological theory of succession. We reviewed the peer reviewed literature published since 1988 that is listed in the ISI Web of Science journals as well as additional references, such as key books. We exclusively focused on large coastal dune systems (such as transgressive and parabolic dunefields) located on natural or seminatural coasts. We found 150 articles that included "coastal dune", "restoration" and "revegetation" in areas such as title, keywords and abstract. From these, 67 dealt specifically with coastal dune restoration. Most of the studies were performed in the USA, The Netherlands and South Africa, during the last two decades. Restoration success has been assessed directly and indirectly by measuring one or a few ecosystem variables. Some ecosystem attributes have been monitored more frequently (ecosystem integrity) than others (ecosystem health and sustainability). Finally, it is important to consider that ecological succession is a desirable approach in restoration actions. Natural dynamics and disturbances should be considered as part of the restored system, to improve ecosystem integrity, health and sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, the EM fungal community was affected by different factors in the different forest successional stages, and the importance of these factors in structuring EM fungal community dramatically decreased along the secondary forest succession series. * This study suggests that different assembly mechanisms operate on the EM fungal community at different stages in secondary subtropical forest succession.},

Two 200 m(2) experimental plots were established at the border between a Japanese black pine- and a black locust-dominated area in a coastal forest. The ECM fungal community of pine seedlings was examined by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis. We analyzed the relationship between ECM formation, ECM community, growth, and nutrient status of pine seedlings and environmental conditions using the Mantel test and structural equation model. Percentages of ECM root tips, the number of ECM fungal species and ECM diversity on pine seedlings decreased in the black locust-dominated area. Cenococcum geophilum and Russula spp. were dominant in the Japanese black pine-dominated area, whereas Tomentella spp. were dominant in the black locust-dominated area. Nitrogen (N) concentration in soils or pine seedlings strongly influenced the percentage of ECM root tips, the number of ECM fungal species and ECM fungal similarity. These results imply the long-term eutrophication caused by N-fixing trees can change ECM formation and ECM community structure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite long-held interest, knowledge on why leaf size varies widely among species is still incomplete. This study was conducted to assess whether abiotic factors, phylogenetic histories and multi-trait interactions act together to shape leaf size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Fifty-seven pairs of altitudinal vicariant species were selected in northern Spain, and leaf area and a number of functionally related leaf, shoot and whole plant traits were measured for each pair. Structural equation modelling helped unravel trait interactions affecting leaf size, and Mantel tests weighed the relative relevance of phylogeny, environment and trait interactions to explain leaf size reduction with altitude.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Leaves of highland vicariants were generally smaller than those of lowlands. However, the extent of leaf size reduction with increasing altitude was widely variable among genera: from approx. 700 cm(2) reduction (96 {\%} in Polystichum) to approx. 30 cm(2) increase (37 {\%} in Sorbus). This was partially explained by shifts in leaf, shoot and whole plant traits (35-64 {\%} of explained variance, depending on models), with size/number trade-offs more influential than shifts in leaf form and leaf economics. Shifts in traits were more important than phylogenetic distances or site-specific environmental variation in explaining the degree of leaf size reduction with altitude.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Ecological filters, constraints due to phylogenetic history (albeit modest in the study system), and phenotypic integration contribute jointly to shape single-trait evolution. Here, it was found that phenotypic change was far more important than shared ancestry to explain leaf size differences of closely related species segregated along altitudes.},

abstract = {* Beta diversity is a conceptual link between diversity at local and regional scales. Various additional methodologies of quantifying this and related phenomena have been applied. Among them, measures of pairwise (dis)similarity of sites are particularly popular. Undersampling, i.e. not recording all taxa present at a site, is a common situation in ecological data. Bias in many metrics related to beta diversity must be expected, but only few studies have explicitly investigated the properties of various measures under undersampling conditions. * On the basis of an empirical data set, representing near-complete local inventories of the Lepidoptera from an isolated Pacific island, as well as simulated communities with varying properties, we mimicked different levels of undersampling. We used 14 different approaches to quantify beta diversity, among them dataset-wide multiplicative partitioning (i.e. ‘true beta diversity') and pairwise site x site dissimilarities. We compared their values from incomplete samples to true results from the full data. We used these comparisons to quantify undersampling bias and we calculated correlations of the dissimilarity measures of undersampled data with complete data of sites. * Almost all tested metrics showed bias and low correlations under moderate to severe undersampling conditions (as well as deteriorating precision, i.e. large chance effects on results). Measures that used only species incidence were very sensitive to undersampling, while abundance-based metrics with high dependency on the distribution of the most common taxa were particularly robust. Simulated data showed sensitivity of results to the abundance distribution, confirming that data sets of high evenness and/or the application of metrics that are strongly affected by rare species are particularly sensitive to undersampling. * The class of beta measure to be used should depend on the research question being asked as different metrics can lead to quite different conclusions even without undersampling effects. For each class of metric, there is a trade-off between robustness to undersampling and sensitivity to rare species. In consequence, using incidence-based metrics carries a particular risk of false conclusions when undersampled data are involved. Developing bias corrections for such metrics would be desirable.},

abstract = {Ecologists usually estimate means, but devote much less attention to variation. Te study of variation is a key aspect to understand natural systems and to make predictions regarding them. In community ecology, most studies focus on local species diversity (alpha diversity), but only in recent decades have ecologists devoted proper attention to variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity). Tis is in spite of the fact that the first attempts to estimate beta diversity date back to the pioneering work by Koch and Whittaker in the 1950s. Progress in the last decade has been made in the development both of methods and of hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition. For instance, methods are available to partition total diversity in a region (gamma diversity), in a local component (alpha), and several beta diversities, each corresponding to one scale in a hierarchy. Te popularization of the so-called raw-data approach (based on partial constrained ordination techniques) and the distance-based approach (based on correlation of dissimilarity/ distance matrices) have allowed many ecologists to address current hypotheses about beta diversity patterns. Overall, these hypotheses are based on niche and neutral theory, accounting for the relative roles of environmental and spatial processes (or a combination of them) in shaping metacommunities. Recent studies have addressed these issues on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, habitats and taxonomic groups. Moreover, life history and functional traits of species such as dispersal abilities and rarity have begun to be considered in studies of beta diversity. In this article we briefly review some of these new tools and approaches developed in recent years, and illustrate them by using case studies in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Darwin first proposed that species with larger ecological breadth have greater phenotypic variation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing intraspecific variation in specific leaf area (SLA) to species' local elevational range and by assessing how external (abiotic) filters may influence observed differences in ecological breadth among species. Understanding the patterns of individual variation within and between populations will help evaluate differing hypotheses for structuring of communities and distribution of species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We selected 21 species with varying elevational ranges and compared the coefficient of variation of SLA for each species against its local elevational range. We examined the influence of external filters on local trait composition by determining if intraspecific changes in SLA with elevation have the same direction and similar rates of change as the change in community mean SLA value.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: In support of Darwin's hypothesis, we found a positive relationship between species' coefficient of variation for SLA with species' local elevational range. Intraspecific changes in SLA had the same sign, but generally lower magnitude than the community mean SLA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that wide-ranging species are indeed characterized by greater intraspecific variation and that species' phenotypes shift along environmental gradients in the same direction as the community phenotypes. However, across species, the rate of intraspecific trait change, reflecting plastic and/or adaptive changes across populations, is limited and prevents species from adjusting to environmental gradients as quickly as interspecific changes resulting from community assembly.},

abstract = {AimsThe aim of this article is threefold. First, we present an updated version of a published megaphylogeny of vascular plants that can be used in studies of plant ecology and biogeography. Second, we develop a tool that can be used by botanists and plant ecologists to generate phylogenetic hypotheses in three scenarios. Third, we use a set of regional assemblages of angiosperm trees in North America as a model system to evaluate the effect of differences in phylogenies generated using the three scenarios on the quantification of phylogenetic properties and the relationship between measures of phylogenetic properties and environment.MethodsThe taxonomy and nomenclature of plant species in the megaphylogeny were standardized according to The Plant List (version 1.1). A tool for generating phylogenies was created using the R language. The robustness of derived phylogenies was evaluated using correlation and regression analyses.Important FindingsAn updated megaphylogeny of vascular plants (PhytoPhylo) and a tool for reconstructing phylogenies of seed plants (S.PhyloMaker) were generated. Our study shows that phylogenies generated by S.PhyloMaker using the PhytoPhylo megaphylogeny as a backbone are nearly as good as phylogeny resolved at the species level when using derived phylogenies to quantify phylogenetic properties (e.g. phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic relatedness) of biological assemblages, and that S.PhyloMaker-generated phylogenies are robust for studies of community ecology and biogeography, particularly those seeking for patterns of phylogenetic properties along environmental gradients.},

Several studies show that rare taxa have lower levels of self-incompatibility, a tendency toward asexual reproductive pathways, lower overall reproductive effort and poorer dispersal abilities. There are several mechanisms that could be responsible for such differences, but they may in practice be difficult to differentiate. Nonetheless, the documentation of recurrent rare-common differences is of vital importance because it may allow us to compensate partially for the bias of the published literature toward studies of common taxa. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {The search for predictions of species diversity across environmental gradients has challenged ecologists for decades. The humped-back model (HBM) suggests that plant diversity peaks at intermediate productivity; at low productivity few species can tolerate the environmental stresses, and at high productivity a few highly competitive species dominate. Over time the HBM has become increasingly controversial, and recent studies claim to have refuted it. Here, by using data from coordinated surveys conducted throughout grasslands worldwide and comprising a wide range of site productivities, we provide evidence in support of the HBM pattern at both global and regional extents. The relationships described here provide a foundation for further research into the local, landscape, and historical factors that maintain biodiversity},

We aimed to disentangle the effect of species interactions (second-order effects) and environment (first-order effects) on the species' spatial distributions. To characterize first-order associations (segregation, overlap), we developed a classification scheme based on Ripley's K and nearest-neighbor statistics. We subsequently used heterogeneous Poisson null models, accounting for possible environmental heterogeneity, to reveal significant uni- and bivariate second-order interactions (regularity, aggregation and repulsion, attraction). First-order effects were strong; overall, 53{\%} of all species pairs occupied largely disjoint areas (segregation), 40{\%} showed partial overlap, and 6{\%} overlapped. Only 5{\%} of all species pairs showed significant second-order effects, but about half of the species showed significant intraspecific effects. Significant plant-plant interactions occurred mostly within 2-4 m and disappeared within 15-20 m of the focal plant. While lack of significant species interactions suggests support for the unified neutral theory, species' observed spatial segregation does not support the assumptions of the neutral theory. The strong observed tendency of species to segregate may have supplementary effects on other processes promoting species coexistence.},

abstract = {We aimed to verify if frugivory in Tyrannidae birds (tyrants flycatchers) is influenced by environmental conditions, spatial filters, phylogenetic structure and food availability in Brazilian Araucaria forests. We used range maps to describe Tyrannidae species composition of 33 cells (0.25°× 0.25°) distributed along the Araucaria forest distribution range. Araucaria forests occur in southern and southeastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina, from 30°S to 20°S and at elevations above 500 m a.s.l. We compiled the feeding habits of each species from literature to calculate the proportion of frugivorous Tyrannidae in each cell. After that, we evaluated separately the influence of environmental descriptors, spatial filters (PCNM), phylogenetic structure (PCPS) and resource availability (proportion of zoochorous species) on the proportion of frugivorous birds using model selection based on AIC. Then we built a path model to evaluate the direct and indirect influences of different set of variables on frugivory. The path model showed that phylogenetic structure and spatial filters were the main factors determining the variation in frugivory in Araucaria forest sites. The environmental variable had no direct effect on frugivory, but presented an indirect effect via phylogenetic structure. Furthermore, zoochory was not selected as an important variable determining any other and was not included in the model. Our results showed that the influence of environment on frugivory by Tyrannidae birds was indirect via spatial and phylogenetic structure, that zoochory was not an important factor determining frugivory and that phylogenetic niche conservatism in feeding habits plays a role in determining the structure of Tyrannidae bird communities in Brazilian Araucaria forests.},

We review how beta-diversity is impacted by human activities, including farming, selective logging, urbanization, species invasions, overhunting, and climate change. Beta-diversity increases, decreases, or remains unchanged by these impacts, depending on the balance of processes that cause species composition to become more different (biotic heterogenization) or more similar (biotic homogenization) between sites. While maintaining high beta-diversity is not always a desirable conservation outcome, understanding beta-diversity is essential for protecting regional diversity and can directly assist conservation planning. Beta-diversity reveals the spatial scaling of diversity loss.Beta-diversity illuminates mechanisms of regional diversity maintenance.Human activities cause beta-diversity to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.Conservation significance of beta-diversity shift depends on local diversity dynamics.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of communities has recently gained much attention in ecology. Spatial structure comprises an important element in communities, but the literature lacks a thorough investigation about possible among-organism or among-ecosystem differences in the degree of spatial structure. Here, I conducted a quantitative review to determine if the degree of spatial structure varied predictably between the major organism types and ecosystems. Spatial structure was quantified as the relative fraction of community variation explained purely by spatial variables (fraction S/E). I integrated data from 322 variation partition analyses both in a generalized linear model (GLM) and using a boosted regression tree method, and showed that a mean of 11.0{\%} of the variation in community composition was explained purely by spatial variables. Across all taxa, a body size–S/E relationship was positive. In GLM, fraction S/E increased highly significantly with study extent, it was highest among terrestrial taxa and higher in ectotherms than in homoiotherms. Spatial structure was also higher in omnivores than in autotrophs. These results suggest that the degree of spatial structure is jointly driven by extrinsic factors such as study extent and ecosystem type, and intrinsic factors such as body size, thermoregulation and interactions between body size and dispersal mode. These results should be important not only for basic research, but also conservation and bioassessment programs would benefit from the information about the magnitude of spatial variation in nature.},

abstract = {We tested the prediction from spatial competition models that intraspecific aggregation may promote coexistence and thus maintain biodiversity with experimental communities of four annual species. Monocultures, three-species mixtures, and the four- species mixture were sown at two densities and with either random or intraspecifically aggregated distributions. There was a hierarchy of competitive abilities among the four species. The weaker competitors showed higher aboveground biomass in the aggregated distribution compared to the random distribution, especially at high density. In one species, intraspecific aggregation resulted in an 86{\%} increase in the number of flowering individuals and a 171{\%} increase in the reproductive biomass at high density. The competitively superior species had a lower biomass in the aggregated distribution than in the random distribution at high density. The data support the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants profoundly affects competition in such a way that weaker competitors increase their fitness while stronger competitors are suppressed when grown in the neighborhood of conspecifics. This implies that the spatial arrangement of plants in a community can be an important determinant of species coexistence and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Tropical forest vegetation is shaped by climate and by soil, but understanding how the distributions of individual tree species respond to specific resources has been hindered by high diversity and consequent rarity. To study species over an entire community, we surveyed trees and measured soil chemistry across climatic and geological gradients in central Panama and then used a unique hierarchical model of species occurrence as a function of rainfall and soil chemistry to circumvent analytical difficulties posed by rare species. The results are a quantitative assessment of the responses of 550 tree species to eight environmental factors, providing a measure of the importance of each factor across the entire tree community. Dry-season intensity and soil phosphorus were the strongest predictors, each affecting the distribution of more than half of the species. Although we anticipated clear-cut responses to dry-season intensity, the finding that many species have pronounced associations with either high or low phosphorus reveals a previously unquantified role for this nutrient in limiting tropical tree distributions. The results provide the data necessary for understanding distributional limits of tree species and predicting future changes in forest composition.},

abstract = {A regional species pool comprises all species available to colonize a focal site. The roots of the concept are imbedded in island biogeography the-ory, supply-side ecology, and early propagule addition experiments. The pool concept allows ecologists to examine large-scale effects—including ge-ographic area, evolutionary age, and immigration and diversification—on the diversity, composition, and phylogenetic structure of local communi-ties. Both theory and evidence show that pool influences are greatest when local communities are not strongly and predictably structured by species interactions (e.g., under frequent disturbance or if many species are rare). Practical and conceptual issues to consider when delineating species pools include choosing an appropriate spatial scale, whether to account for envi-ronmental filtering, whether to include the species within a fixed geographic area versus those whose geographic ranges overlap with a site, or whether to use databases or geographic data sources. Each issue is discussed in the context of 63 studies using the species pool approach. We conclude that the species pool concept has contributed greatly to our understanding of com-munity dynamics by bridging the gap between large and small spatial scales. Future studies must compare pool characteristics with community structure across multiple regions for a more complete understanding of community assembly.},

abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63{\%} and 98{\%} of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32{\%} and 89{\%} of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47{\%} of fish species and 55{\%} of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {* One of the primary goals in community ecology is to determine the relative importance of processes and mechanisms that control biodiversity. Here, we examined habitat-driven species assemblages and species distribution patterns as well as their temporal variations for three life stages of two censuses of a 25-ha mixed dipterocarp forest at Sinharaja (Sri Lanka). * Our general objective was to find out whether the species assemblages and associated habitat types changed with life stage, spatial scale and species attributes. We also analyse whether the habitat types were related to certain indicator species. Habitat types were determined with multivariate regression tree analyses driven by topographic variables. * We found species assemblages associated with five distinct habitat types that appeared consistently for all life stages of the two censuses. These habitats were related to ridge-valley gradients and a pronounced contrast in south-west versus north-east aspect. Habitat-driven structuring was weak at the recruit stage but strong in the juvenile and adult stages. The species assemblage variance explained by topographic variables for different life stages ranged between 10{\%} for recruits and 23{\%} for juveniles. * The species assemblages determined for different spatial scales (10, 20, 50 m) showed similar habitat partitioning, but the variance explained by the topographic variables increased in all life stages with spatial scale. This could be due to the homogenizing effect of topographic variables at the larger scales and unaccounted environmental variation at the smaller scales. The number of indicator species identified in the two censuses was higher in the juvenile stage than in the adult stage, and nearly all indicator species in the adult stage were also indicator species in the juvenile stage. * Synthesis. Our study showed that approximately 75{\%} of the variance in local species composition is unexplained. This may be due to spatially structured processes such as dispersal limitation, unaccounted biotic and abiotic environmental variables, and stochastic effects, but only 25{\%} were due to topographic habitat association. Although the pronounced ridge-valley gradient and contrast of south-west versus north-east aspect created consistent habitats, our results suggest that local species assemblages at Sinharaja forest are jointly shaped by neutral and niche processes.},

abstract = {A current focus of ecology is the investigation of spatial effects on population and community dynamics; however, spatiotemporal theory remains largely untested by observations or experimental studies. For empirical example, the segregation hypothesis predicts that intraspecific aggregation should increase the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition, thereby enhancing local coexistence in plant communities. We applied recent methods of point pattern analysis to analyze a unique long term data set on fully mapped seedling emergence and subsequent survival in a Mediterranean gorse shrubland after experimental fires and simulated torrential rainfall events. Our overall aim was to test if the observed spatial patterns were consistent with the segregation hypothesis during the entire community dynamics from early seedling emergence to the establishment of a mature i.e., we explored if the observed community, initial segregation did indeed prevent interspecific competition from becoming dominant. We used random labeling as the null model and specific test statistics to evaluate different biological effects of the spatial interactions that determine mortality. We found that mortality was clearly not random. Comparison of the probability of mortality in dependence on the distance to conspecific and to heterospecific plants showed that mortality was controlled almost entirely by intraspecific interactions, which is consistent with the segregation hypothesis. Dead plants were aggregated and segregated from surviving plants, indicating two-sided scramble competition. Spatial interactions were density dependent and changed their sign over the course of time from positive to negative when plants grew to The simulated torrential rainfall events and subsequent erosion caused maturity. nonspecific mortality of seedlings but did not reduce the prevalence of intraspecific competition. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants may determinant in the coexistence of profoundly affect competition and can be an important species and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Question: Is a mosaic structure apparent in the spatial distribution of trees in old-growth Abies amabilis forests? Location: Montane forests of the western Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Methods: Maps of tree locations were created for study areas located in two, 300-year old stands and a single 600-year old stand. Stand structure parameters were calculated using several subsample quadrats sizes (56.25 - 306.25 m(2)), which were drawn randomly with replacement at a density of 250 quadrats per ha from the stem maps in the computing environment. Spatial cross-covariance functions between different canopy strata were estimated using the spline cross-correlogram. Results: Negative spatial correlation (segregation) between subcanopy tree density and areas of high overstorey occupancy was detected. Understorey and midstorey tree densities were positively spatially correlated. These general trends were apparent across the range of observational scales investigated. Significant spatial correlation between canopy strata was observed at spatial scales of 12 - 44 m and extended to the largest scales in the 600-year old stand. Conclusion: The observed spatial segregation between canopy strata supports the hypothesis that old A. amabilis forests form fine-scale structural mosaics. Structural segregation at small scales may be due to competitive interactions as well as exogenous forcing of tree locations (e.g. by mortality due to pathogen or disturbance), however segregation at large scales in the 600-year old stand is likely due to exogenous factors alone. This study reinforces the idea that horizontal heterogeneity is an emergent property of old-growth forests.},

@article{Houseman2014,
abstract = {AimsSpecies aggregation is commonly seen in plant communities and may increase diversity by causing intraspecific competition to exceed interspecific competition. One potential source of this spatial aggregation is seed dispersal but it is unclear to what extent aggregated seed distributions affect plant diversity in real communities. Using a field experiment, I tested whether uniform or aggregated seed arrival alters community structure and whether these effects vary with sowing density.MethodsThe experiment consisted of two spatial seeding treatments (uniform and aggregated) that were fully crossed with three seed density treatments. Sixty, 3 × 4-m plots were arrayed in a low-diversity grassland located in Kansas, USA. Each plot was divided into forty-eight, 0.5 × 0.5-m patches. For aggregated seeding treatments, each of the 15 species was sown into three randomly selected patches within the plot (3×15 = 45). To create a uniform species arrival but control for the seed addition method, all 15 species were sown into 45 individual patches (with three patches remaining unsown) within each plot. Seed mass for each species was held constant at the plot scale between uniform or aggregated treatments within a given level of the sowing density treatment. After two growing seasons, plant density was quantified for all sown species in 15 randomly selected patches from each plot.Important FindingsI found evidence for shifts in community structure in response to the different spatial seeding patterns. The evenness of added species was higher under aggregated than uniform sowing patterns. There was no detectable effect of aggregated seed sowing on species richness at 3.75 m 2 scale. However, when species richness was extrapolated to larger scales (11.25 m2), aggregated sowing was predicted to have greater richness than uniform sowing. Effects of seed aggregation on community structure were apparent only at moderate to high sowing rates, yet the latter are within the range of measured seed dispersal in similar grasslands. Additionally, as sowing density increased, seed mass became an increasingly effective predictor of relative abundances for added species, but only under uniform sowing patterns supporting the idea that aggregated dispersal may buffer weaker (smaller seeded) species from competition during colonization. This is the first experiment to show that aggregated seed dispersal patterns can increase at least some components of plant diversity in undisturbed grasslands and suggests that previous seed dispersal experiments, which utilize uniform seed sowing, may underestimate the potential effect of dispersal on plant community structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

@article{Lamosova2010,
abstract = {Plant species create aggregations of conspecifics as a consequence of limited seed dispersal, clonal growth and heterogeneous environment. Such intraspecific aggregation increases the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition which may slow down competitive exclusion and promote species coexistence. To examine how spatial aggregation impacts the functioning of experimental assemblages of varying species richness, eight perennial grassland species of different growth form were grown in random and aggregated patterns in monocultures, two-, four-, and eight-species mixtures. In mixtures with an aggregated pattern, monospecific clumps were interspecifically segregated. Mixed model ANOVA was used to test (i) how the total productivity and productivity of individual species is affected by the number of species in a mixture, and (ii) how these relationships are affected by spatial pattern of sown plants. The main patterns of productivity response to species richness conform to other studies: non-transgressive overyielding is omnipresent (the productivity of mixtures is higher than the average of its constituent species so that the net diversity, selection and complementarity effects are positive), whereas transgressive overyielding is found only in a minority of cases (average of log(overyielding) being close to zero or negative). The theoretical prediction that plants in a random pattern should produce more than in an aggregated pattern (the distances to neighbours are smaller and consequently the competition among neighbours stronger) was confirmed in monocultures of all the eight species. The situation is more complicated in mixtures, probably as a consequence of complicated interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition. The most productive species (Achillea, Holcus, Plantago) were competitively superior and increased their relative productivity with mixture richness. The intraspecific competition of these species is stronger than that of most other species. The aggregated pattern in the full mixture increased the survival of subordinate species, and consequently, we conclude that an aggregated pattern can promote species coexistence (or at least postpone competitive exclusion), particularly in comparison with homogeneously sown mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Recent work suggests that soil nutrient hetero- geneity may modulate plant responses to drivers of global change, but interactions between N heterogeneity and changes in rainfall regime remain poorly understood. We used a model grassland system to investigate the interactive effects of N application pattern (homogeneous, heterogene- ous) and precipitation-magnitude manipulation during the growing season (control, +50 {\%} rainfall, −50 {\%} rainfall) on aboveground biomass and plant community dominance patterns. Our study resulted in four major findings: patchy N addition increased within-plot variability in plant size structure at the species level, but did not alter total above- ground biomass; patchy N addition increased community dominance and caused a shift in the ranking of subordi- nate plant species; unlike community-level biomass, plant species differed in their biomass response to the rainfall treatments; and neither aboveground biomass nor commu- nity dominance showed significant interactions between N pattern and rainfall manipulation, suggesting that grassland responses to patchy N inputs are insensitive to water addi- tion or rainfall reduction in our temperate study system. Overall, our results indicate that the spatial pattern of N inputs has greater effects on species biomass variability and community dominance than on aboveground production. These short-term changes in plant community structure may have significant implications for longer-term patterns of vegetation dynamics and plant-soil feedbacks. Moreo- ver our results suggest that the magnitude of precipitation during the growing season plays a limited role in grassland responses to heterogeneous organic N inputs, emphasiz- ing the need to consider other components of precipitation change in future heterogeneity studies.},

abstract = {Aim Macroclimate is a major determinant of large-scale diversity patterns. However, the influence of smaller-scale factors on local diversity across large spatial extents is not well documented. Here, we quantify the relative importance of local (patch-scale), landscape-scale and macroclimatic drivers of herbaceous species diversity in small forest patches in agricultural landscapes across Europe. Location Deciduous forest patches in eight regions along a macroclimatic gradient from southern France to central Sweden and Estonia. Methods The diversity of forest specialists and generalists at three levels (whole forest patch, sampling plots within patches and between scales) was related to patch-scale (forest area, age, abiotic and biotic heterogeneity), landscape-scale (amount of forest, grasslands and hedgerows around the patch, patch isolation) and macroclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation) using generalized linear mixed models and variation partitioning for each group of variables. Results The total amount of explained variation in diversity ranged from 8{\%} for plot-scale diversity of generalists to 54{\%} for patch-scale diversity of forest specialists. Patch-scale variables always explained more than 60{\%} of the explained variation in diversity, mainly due to the positive effect of within-patch heterogeneity on patch-scale and between-scale diversities and to the positive effect of patch age on plot-scale diversity of forest specialists. Landscape-scale variables mainly contributed to the amount of explained variation in plot-scale diversity, being more important for forest specialists (21{\%}) than for generalists (18{\%}). Macroclimatic variables contributed a maximum of 11{\%} to the plot-scale diversity of generalists. Main conclusions Macroclimate poorly predicts local diversity across Europe, and herbaceous diversity is mainly explained by habitat features, less so by landscape structure. We show the importance of conserving old forest patches as refugia for typical forest species, and of enhancing the landscape context around the patches by reducing the degree of disturbance caused by agriculture.},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Generalized linear models (GLMs) and classification trees were developed to predict the presence of four vegetation alliances in a section of the Mojave Desert in California. Generalized additive models were used to provide response shapes for parameterizing GLMs. Environmental variables used to model the distribution of the alliances included temperature, precipitation, elevation, elevation-derived terrain variables (slope, transformed aspect, topographic moisture index, solar radiation, and landscape position), and categorical landform/surface composition variables. Vegetation distributions exhibit spatial dependence and therefore we used indicator kriging to derive neighborhood values of ‘‘presence'' also used as predictors in the models. The models were developed using 2859 observations coded present or absent for each of the four alliances, and assessed using 960 observations. In general, all of the models were improved with the addition of the kriged dependence term. However, models that relied heavily on the kriged dependence term were less generalizable for predictive purposes. Classification tree models had higher classification accuracy with the training data, but were less robust when used for predictions with the test data. Each of the models was used to generate a map of predictions for each alliance and the results were often quite different. The predicted maps with the kriged dependence terms looked unrealistically smooth, particularly in the classification tree models where they were often selected as the most important variables, and therefore heavily influenced the spatial pattern of the resulting map predictions.},

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {Predictive vegetation modeling (PVM), is defined as predicting the distribution of vegetation across a landscape based on the relationship between the spatial distribution of vegetation and environmental variables. PVM requires digital maps of the environmental variables, as well as spatial information on the vegetation attribute of interest (e.g., species, type, abundance), usually from a sample of locations. Often these predictive models are developed using traditional statistical methods and are based on the implicit assumption that the distribution of vegetation is random and, therefore, each observation is independent. This approach violates one of the basic tenets of geography, the direct relationship between distance and likeness, as well as of ecological theory, that elements of an ecosystem close to one another are more likely to be influenced by the same generating process and will therefore be similar. Some of the spatial structure can be explained by the predictor variables used in the model. Environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature and elevation exhibit spatial dependence, some of which is responsible for spatial clustering in vegetation distribution, but remaining spatial dependence can result from either unmeasured environmental variables or biotic processes that cause spatial clustering. Spatial dependence in biogeographical data has been recently identified as an important area of future PVM research, and many studies have begun to explore ways to incorporate spatial dependence in predictive models. Here we review the different approaches to incorporating spatial dependence into predictive vegetation models focusing on four statistical methods: autoregressive models, geostatistics, geographically weighted regression, and parameter estimation models. Autoregressive models may be more capable of describing the fine-scaled spatial dependence that results from local biotic factors, such as disturbance, competition, or dispersal, while geostatistical methods may be more suitable for modeling broad-scale spatial dependence. The other methods focus on global and local parameter estimation in the presence of spatially structured or nonstationary data. While this review focuses on incorporating spatial dependence into statistical models for predictive purposes, explicitly including spatial dependence in models can also aid in clarifying the effect of different explanatory variables, thereby improving inferences. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ellison2004,
abstract = {Abstract Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

abstract = {1. Animportant problem encountered by ecologists in species distribution modelling (SDM)and inmultivariate analysis is that of understanding why environmental responses differ across species, and how differences are mediated by functional traits. 2. We describe a simple, generic approach to this problem – the core idea being to fit a predictive model for species abundance (or presence/absence) as a function of environmental variables, species traits and their interaction. 3. We show that this method can be understood as a model-based approach to the fourth-corner problem – the problem of studying the environment–trait association using matrices of abundance or presence/absence data across species, environmental data across sites and trait data across species. The matrix of environment–trait interaction coefficients is the fourth corner. 4. We illustrate that compared with existing approaches to the fourth-corner problem, the proposedmodel-based approach has advantages in interpretability and its capacity to perform model selection andmake predictions. 5. To illustrate the method we used a generalized linear model with a LASSO penalty, fitted to data sets from four different studies requiring different models, illustrating the flexibility of the proposed approach. 6. Predictive performance of the model is compared with that of fitting SDMs separately to each species, and in each case, it is shown that the trait model, despite beingmuch simpler, had comparable predictive performance, even significantly outperforming separate SDMs in some cases.

We implement this model across the Phoenix metropolis and surrounding desert. Using a Bayesian approach, we utilized the Langevin-Hastings hybrid algorithm. Under a generalization of a spatial log-Gaussian Cox model, the log-intensities of the species count processes follow Gaussian distributions. The purely spatial component corresponding to these log-intensities are jointly modeled using a cross-convolution approach, in order to depict a valid cross-correlation structure. We observe that this approach yields non-stationarity of the model ensuing from different land use types. We obtain predictions of various measures of plant diversity including plant richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity at observed locations.

abstract = {Question Quantification of the effect of species traits on the assembly of communities is challenging from a statistical point of view. A key question is how species occurrence and abundance can be explained by the trait values of the species and the environmental values at the sites. Methods Using a sites × species abundance table, a site × environment data table and a species × trait data table, we address the above question using a novel generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The GLMM overcomes problems of pseudo-replication and heteroscedastic variance by including sites and species as random factors. The method is equally applicable to presence–absence data as to count and multinomial data. We present a tiered forward selection approach for obtaining a parsimonious model and compare the results with alternative methods (the fourth corner method and RLQ ordination). Results We illustrate the approach on a presence–absence version on two data sets. In the Dune Meadow data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by moisture and manure on the meadows in combination with seed mass and specific leaf area (SLA). In the Grazed Grassland data, species presence is parsimoniously explained by the grazing intensity and soil phosphorus in combination with the C:N ratio and flowering mode. Conclusions Our GLMM approach can be used to identify which species traits and environmental variables best explain the species distribution, and which traits are significantly correlated with environmental variables. We argue that the method is better suited for providing an interpretable and predictive model than the fourth corner method and RLQ.},

abstract = {The continuum hypothesis has been proposed as a means to reconcile the contradiction between the niche and neutral theories. While past research has shown that species richness affects the location of communities along the niche-neutrality continuum, there may be extrinsic forces at play as well. We used a spatially explicit continuum model to quantify the effects of environmental heterogeneity, comprising abundance distribution and spatial configuration of resources, on the degree of community neutrality. We found that both components of heterogeneity affect the degree of community neutrality and that species' dispersal characteristics affect the neutrality-heterogeneity relationship. Narrower resource abundance distributions decrease neutrality, while spatial configuration, which is manifested by spatial aggregation of resources, decreases neutrality at higher aggregation levels. In general, the degree of community neutrality was affected by complex interactions among spatial configuration of resources, their abundance distributions and the dispersal characteristics of species in the community. Our results highlight the important yet overlooked role of the environment in dictating the location of communities along the hypothesized niche-neutrality continuum.},

abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is ade-quately characterized using two independent axes: the fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a repro-ductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative inde-pendence of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may comple-ment trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; to-gether these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments. life history strategy | iteroparity | generation time | matrix population model | phylogenetic signal D emographic schedules of survival, growth, and reproduction, which comprise life-history strategies, are fundamental to our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as invasions and local extinctions (1–3), com-munity structure (4, 5), and species diversification (6, 7). Con-sequently, the development and careful testing of theory on how organisms allocate resources to survival, growth, and reproduction are important goals for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conser-vation biology (8). Indeed, calls for the development of a " periodic table " to classify species based on their life-history strategies and to predict population dynamics and community composition go back to the early development of evolutionary biology as a discipline (9). A main axiom of life-history theory is that trade-offs (i.e., bud-getary compromises) between different aspects of an organism's demographic schedules, such as survival, growth, and/or re-production, constrain and optimize the range of possible life-history strategies that can evolve across the tree of life (10, 11). However, the plant kingdom encompasses a vast amount of life-history variation; plant longevity, for instance, ranges from weeks to millennia (12). Many plant species' life cycles include cryptic life stages such as seedbanks (13) or dormant adults (similar to animal hibernation) (14). Reproduction also can be highly vari-able among plants, with seed mass and per-capita seed pro-duction ranging across six orders of magnitude (15). Previous classifications of plant life-history strategies have been limited in geographic (16, 17), taxonomic, and phylogenetic scales (17) and in the ability to differentiate life-history trade-offs (17–19). Here we propose an approach analogous to that developed decades ago for vertebrates (20) to study the drivers behind plant life-history variation. We combine demographic, phylogenetic, and ecological data from natural populations of 418 plant species worldwide (Fig. 1) to address the following questions: (i) What are the main axes of variation of plant life-history strategies? (ii) To what extent do phylogenetic ancestry, habitat, growth form, and size constrain plant life-history variation? We then test whether the position of a species on these axes predicts two important metrics of population performance: population growth rate and speed of recovery from disturbances. If clear patterns emerge, they may form the basis for a satisfactory classification and predictive},

abstract = {Interpretation of results that include multiple statistical tests has been an issue of great concern for some time in the ecological literature. The basic problem is that when multiple tests are undertaken, each at the same significance level ( ), the probability of achieving at least one significant result is greater than that signifi- cance level (Zaykin et al. 2002). Therefore, there is an increased probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it would be inappropriate to do so. The typical solution to this problem has been lowering the values for the table (i.e. establishing a table-wide significance level) and therefore reducing the probability of a spurious result. Specifically, the most common procedure has been the application of the sequential Bonferroni adjustment (Holm 1979, Miller 1981, Rice 1989). Arguments in this essay address the problems of adjusting probability values for tables of multiple statistical tests, and more specifically argue for rejection of the sequential Bonferroni as a solution to this problem. Since the influential publication of Rice (1989), the sequential Bonferroni correction has become the primary method of addressing the problem of multiple statistical tests in ecological research. The sequential Bonferroni adjusts the table-wide p-value to keep it constant at 0.05, and subsequently reduces the probability of a spurious result. Although other methods exist for addressing tables of multiple statistical tests, the sequential Bonferroni has become the most commonly utilized process. However, this method has several flaws ranging from mathematical to logical to practical that argue for rejecting this method in ecological studies.},

Here we first elaborate a novel conceptual framework posing specific hypotheses and predictions about the environmental and ecological contexts underlying the contribution of ITV to community trait turnover. We then empirically test these predictions in understory herbaceous plant communities in a montane environment, for 3 functional traits (flowering phenology, specific leaf area and height). We found that different components of trait variation mapped onto different environmental axes, specifically reporting a greater contribution of ITV along non-climatic axes (e.g., soil properties, light) than along the main climatic axis (i.e., ele...},

abstract = {1 We mapped and identified all trees greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter in 25 ha of lowland wet forest in Amazonian Ecuador, and found 1104 morphospecies among 152 353 individuals. The largest number of species was mid-sized canopy trees with maximum height 10-20 m and understorey treelets with maximum height of 5-10 m. 2 Several species of understorey treelets in the genera Matisia and Rinorea dominated the forest numerically, while important canopy species were Iriartea deltoidea and Eschweilera coriacea. 3 We examined how species partition local topographic variation into niches, and how much this partitioning contributes to forest diversity. Evidence in favour of topographic niche-partitioning was found: similarity in species composition between ridge and valley quadrats was lower than similarity between two valley (or two ridge) quadrats, and 25{\%} of the species had large abundance differences between valley and ridge-top. On the other hand, 25{\%} of the species were generalists, with similar abundance on both valley and ridges, and half the species had only moderate abundance differences between valley and ridge. 4 Topographic niche-partitioning was not finely grained. There were no more than three distinct vegetation zones: valley, mid-slope, and upper-ridge, and the latter two differed only slightly in species composition. 5 Similarity in species composition declined with distance even within a topographic habitat, to about the same degree as it declined between habitats. This suggests patchiness not related to topographic variation, and possibly due to dispersal limitation. 6 We conclude that partitioning of topographic niches does make a contribution to the alpha-diversity of Amazonian trees, but only a minor one. It provides no explanation for the co-occurrence of hundreds of topographic generalists, nor for the hundreds of species with similar life-form appearing on a single ridge-top.},

abstract = {Large-diameter trees dominate the structure, dynamics and function of many temperate and tropical forests. Although both scaling theory and competition theory make predictions about the relative composition and spatial patterns of large-diameter trees compared to smaller diameter trees, these predictions are rarely tested. We established a 25.6 ha permanent plot within which we tagged and mapped all trees ≥1 cm dbh, all snags ≥10 cm dbh, and all shrub patches ≥2 m(2). We sampled downed woody debris, litter, and duff with line intercept transects. Aboveground live biomass of the 23 woody species was 507.9 Mg/ha, of which 503.8 Mg/ha was trees (SD = 114.3 Mg/ha) and 4.1 Mg/ha was shrubs. Aboveground live and dead biomass was 652.0 Mg/ha. Large-diameter trees comprised 1.4{\%} of individuals but 49.4{\%} of biomass, with biomass dominated by Abies concolor and Pinus lambertiana (93.0{\%} of tree biomass). The large-diameter component dominated the biomass of snags (59.5{\%}) and contributed significantly to that of woody debris (36.6{\%}). Traditional scaling theory was not a good model for either the relationship between tree radii and tree abundance or tree biomass. Spatial patterning of large-diameter trees of the three most abundant species differed from that of small-diameter conspecifics. For A. concolor and P. lambertiana, as well as all trees pooled, large-diameter and small-diameter trees were spatially segregated through inter-tree distances {\textless}10 m. Competition alone was insufficient to explain the spatial patterns of large-diameter trees and spatial relationships between large-diameter and small-diameter trees. Long-term observations may reveal regulation of forest biomass and spatial structure by fire, wind, pathogens, and insects in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. Sustaining ecosystem functions such as carbon storage or provision of specialist species habitat will likely require different management strategies when the functions are performed primarily by a few large trees as opposed to many smaller trees.},

abstract = {Large-diameter trees dominate the structure, dynamics and function of many temperate and tropical forests. However, their attendant contributions to forest heterogeneity are rarely addressed. We established the Wind River Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25.6 ha permanent plot within which we tagged and mapped all 30,973 woody stems ≥1 cm dbh, all 1,966 snags ≥10 cm dbh, and all shrub patches ≥2 m(2). Basal area of the 26 woody species was 62.18 m(2)/ha, of which 61.60 m(2)/ha was trees and 0.58 m(2)/ha was tall shrubs. Large-diameter trees (≥100 cm dbh) comprised 1.5{\%} of stems, 31.8{\%} of basal area, and 17.6{\%} of the heterogeneity of basal area, with basal area dominated by Tsuga heterophylla and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Small-diameter subpopulations of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata, as well as all tree species combined, exhibited significant aggregation relative to the null model of complete spatial randomness (CSR) up to 9 m (P≤0.001). Patterns of large-diameter trees were either not different from CSR (Tsuga heterophylla), or exhibited slight aggregation (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Thuja plicata). Significant spatial repulsion between large-diameter and small-diameter Tsuga heterophylla suggests that large-diameter Tsuga heterophylla function as organizers of tree demography over decadal timescales through competitive interactions. Comparison among two forest dynamics plots suggests that forest structural diversity responds to intermediate-scale environmental heterogeneity and disturbances, similar to hypotheses about patterns of species richness, and richness- ecosystem function. Large mapped plots with detailed within-plot environmental spatial covariates will be required to test these hypotheses.},

abstract = {The role of competition in tree communities is increasingly well understood, while little is known about the patterns and mechanisms of the interplay between above- and belowground competition in tree communities. This knowledge, however, is crucial for a better understanding of community dynamics and developing adaptive near-natural management strategies. We assessed neighbourhood interactions in an unmanaged old-growth European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest by quantifying variation in the intensity of above- (shading) and belowground competition (crowding) among dominant and co-dominant canopy beech trees during tree maturation. Shading had on average a much larger impact on radial growth than crowding and the sensitivity to changes in competitive conditions was lowest for crowding effects. We found that each mode of competition reduced the effect of the other. Increasing crowding reduced the negative effect of shading, and at high levels of shading, crowding actually had a facilitative effect and increased growth. Our study demonstrates that complementarity in above- and belowground processes enable F. sylvatica to alter resource acquisition strategies, thus optimising tree radial growth. As a result, competition seemed to become less important in stands with a high growing stock and tree communities with a long continuity of anthropogenic undisturbed population dynamics. We suggest that growth rates do not exclusively depend on the density of potential competitors at the intraspecific level, but on the conspecific aggregation of large-diameter trees and their functional role for regulating biotic filtering processes. This finding highlights the potential importance of the rarely examined relationship between the spatial aggregation pattern of large-diameter trees and the outcome of neighbourhood interactions, which may be central to community dynamics and the related forest ecosystem services.},

abstract = {The relative importance of competition vs. environmental filtering in the assembly of communities is commonly inferred from their functional and phylogenetic structure, on the grounds that similar species compete most strongly for resources and are therefore less likely to coexist locally. This approach ignores the possibility that competitive effects can be determined by relative positions of species on a hierarchy of competitive ability. Using growth data, we estimated 275 interaction coefficients between tree species in the French mountains. We show that interaction strengths are mainly driven by trait hierarchy and not by functional or phylogenetic similarity. On the basis of this result, we thus propose that functional and phylogenetic convergence in local tree community might be due to competition-sorting species with different competitive abilities and not only environmental filtering as commonly assumed. We then show a functional and phylogenetic convergence of forest structure with increasing plot age, which supports this view.},

abstract = {Maternal effects arise when a mother's phenotype or the environment she experiences influences the phenotype of her progeny. Most studies of adaptive maternal effects are a "snapshot" of a mother's lifetime offspring provisioning and do not generally consider the effects of earlier siblings on those produced later. Here we show that in soil mites, offspring provisioning strategies are dynamic, changing from an emphasis on egg number in young females to egg size in older females. This pattern may be adaptive if it increases the survival of younger offspring that must compete with older, larger siblings. The dynamic shift in egg provisioning was greater in high-food environments in which females lived longer, creating increasing asymmetry in offspring competitive abilities. Females reared in isolation and in the presence of a high-density colony had identical provisioning strategies, suggesting that, unlike males in this species, females do not use pheromones to assess colony size. Our findings suggest that the adaptive significance of maternal effects may be misinterpreted when studies consider only a snapshot of a female's offspring provisioning strategy or when components of the offspring provisioning strategy are studied in isolation.},

Underpinning all its activities is the IPBES Conceptual Framework (CF), a simplified model of the interactions between nature and people. Drawing on the legacy of previous large-scale environmental assessments, the CF goes further in explicitly embracing different disciplines and knowledge systems (including indigenous and local knowledge) in the co-construction of assessments of the state of the world's biodiversity and the benefits it provides to humans. The CF can be thought of as a kind of "Rosetta Stone" that highlights commonalities between diverse value sets and seeks to facilitate crossdisciplinary and crosscultural understanding. We argue that the CF will contribute to the increasing trend towards interdisciplinarity in understanding and managing the environment. Rather than displacing disciplinary science, however, we believe that the CF will provide new contexts of discovery and policy applications for it.},

Soils are essential resources, providing water and nutrients for vascular plants, and mitigating the flow of water from the land. In addition, soil diversity is critical for biotic diversity. While there are many references on the agricultural perspective of soils, there is a need for a basic soils book for those concerned with natural landscapes and ecosystems. Soils in Natural Landscapes fills this niche, providing a thorough introduction to the physics, chemistry, and biology of soils and their roles in local to global systems.The book begins by describing the field of soils and the major roles of soils in natural landscapes. The chapters that follow cover a range of topics: Soil parent material Architecture of soils Temperature and soils Water, air, and climate Classification of soils Soil landscapes Plant nutrition Soil organisms Organic matter in soilsThe author also discusses global issues such as water and carbon cycles, global warming, and acid rain. He addresses land management for different uses, soil quality, and soil degradation. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this book provides practical insights for the evaluation of soils in natural environments and their non-intensive management.},

abstract = {SignificanceEnvironmental management inevitably involves trade-offs among different objectives, values, and stakeholders. Most evaluations of such trade-offs involve monetary valuation or calculation of aggregate production of ecosystem services, which can mask individual winners and losers. We combine a participatory, modeling, and scenarios approach to identify social-ecological trade-offs in a tropical fishery and the implications on well-being of different stakeholders. Such trade-offs are often ignored because losers are marginalized or not represented by quantification, and because the nature of underlying values may result in socially "taboo" trade-offs that pit incommensurable values against one another. A participatory modeling and scenarios approach can increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of what is socially acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to compliance. Managing ecosystems for multiple ecosystem services and balancing the well-being of diverse stakeholders involves different kinds of trade-offs. Often trade-offs involve noneconomic and difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem structures. Although trade-offs need to be considered for successful environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a diversity of apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of social-ecological system structure and stakeholders' well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were suggested to be "taboo" trade-offs between morally incommensurable values, such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive "toy model" representing key system trade-offs, alongside qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the productivity of hilly grassland of the Xilin River Basin as affected by slope aspect (North versus South), aboveground green biomass (AGB) and species composition were studied at four hill sites in 2005. Additionally, a detailed investigation combining vegetation parameters, physical and chemical soil characteristics was carried out at different slope positions (base, middle, and top) of north and south slope aspect on one of the hills in 2004 and 2005. Northern slopes exhibited a higher productivity and species diversity compared to southern slopes. Plant available soil K, P and N were not limiting the productivity at south- relative to north-oriented slopes, whereas soil available water was the primarily limiting factor for plant productivity, which was supported by results of leaf carbon isotope discrimination of main species. A negative correlation between productivity and relative abundance of C4 plants indicates that the relative biomass of C4 plants can be used as a water-stress indicator. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Since the introduction of covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) by Joreskog in 1973, this technique has been received with considerable interest among empirical researchers. However, the predominance of LISREL, certainly the most well-known tool to perform this kind of analysis, has led to the fact that not all researchers are aware of alternative techniques for SEM, such as partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Therefore, the objective of this article is to provide an easily comprehensible introduction to this technique, which is particularly suited to situations in which constructs are measured by a very large number of indicators and where maximum likelihood covariance-based SEM tools reach their limit. Because this article is intended as a general introduction, it avoids mathematical details as far as possible and instead focuses on a presentation of PLS, which can be understood without an in-depth knowledge of SEM.

abstract = {Multivariate regression trees (MRT) are a new statistical technique that can be used to explore, describe, and predict relationships between multispecies data and environmental characteristics. MRT forms clusters of sites by repeated splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize the dissimilarity of sites within clusters. The measure of species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT can be used to relate any aspect of species composition to environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be used to analyze complex ecological data that may include imbalance, missing values, nonlinear relationships between variables, and high-order interactions. They can also predict species composition at sites for which only environment...},

abstract = {1. Ecological data analysis frequently calls for the assessment of the relationship between species composition and a set of explanatory variables of interest. The assessment may have to be pursued while taking into account the influence of another set of explanatory variables. The hypothetical nature and structure of the influence of an explanatory set on the effect of a distinct explanatory set guides the proper choice ofmodelling methodology for a combined explanatory assessment. 2. Here, we describe a framework where the relationship between the response data and a main set of explanatory variables is not linear. It may, for example, take the form of abrupt changes in the response following thresholds of the explanatory variables, or any other nonlinearizable relation- ship. The influence of a second set of explanatory variables is determined aposteriori,after theinflu- ence of the main explanatory set has been taken into account. This is useful when one of the sets is thought to have an effect that varies as a function of the other. 3. To achieve this type of assessment, we propose a cascade of multivariate regression trees (CMRT). We decompose the total dispersion of a response matrix between two explanatory data sets in a nested manner. By handling each leaf (group) resulting from the first-level multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis as separate independent data sets in following analyses, we can separate the explanatory power of the first partition from those of the subordinate partitions computed using a second explanatory set.Apreliminary biological hypothesis will guide the choice of which set of explanatory variables should be used to compute the main partition. The method could be extended to more than two explanatory data sets whose effects on the response data are hierarchical. 4. Cascade of multivariate regression trees allows the users to impose a nested structure to their causal hypotheses in MRT analysis. To illustrate this new procedure, we use the well-known and readily available Doubs fish and oribatid mite data sets and provide the necessary R functions in a package available onCRAN(http://cran.r-project.org).},

abstract = {Recent developments in complex systems analysis have led to new techniques for detecting causal relationships using relatively short time series, on the order of 30 sequential observations. Although many ecological observation series are even shorter, perhaps fewer than ten sequential observations, these shorter time series are often highly replicated in space (i.e., plot replication). Here, we combine the existing techniques of convergent cross mapping (CCM) and dewdrop regression to build a novel test of causal relations that leverages spatial replication, which we call multispatial CCM. Using examples from simulated and real-world ecological data, we test the ability of multispatial CCM to detect causal relationships between processes. We find that multispatial CCM successfully detects causal relationships with as few as five sequential observations, even in the presence of process noise and observation error. Our results suggest that this technique may constitute a useful test for causality in systems where experiments are difficult to perform and long time series are not available. This new technique is available in the multispatialCCM package for the R programming language.},

Simple generic models have become the tool par excellence for the development of theory. How- ever, the popularity of these abstract theoretical models among practical ecologists is marginal. It is argued that the antagonism against such models is largely due to a misconception about their possible role in the process of unravelling the functioning of ecological communities. We discuss the pitfalls of analyzing the driving causal relationships in real world ecosystems, and evaluate role for minimal models in this context.},

abstract = {Classification and regression trees are ideally suited for the analysis of complex ecological data. For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables, (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these tars. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how Linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.},

@article{Elith2008,
abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

@article{Cardinale2009,
abstract = {The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity-diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity-diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar "patches" to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found co-occurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.},

abstract = {Machine learning methods, a family of statistical techniques with origins in the field of artificial intelligence, are recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of understanding and prediction about ecological phenomena. These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machin learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.},

abstract = {Abstract  The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

abstract = {Linking species and ecosystems often relies on approaches that consider how the traits exhibited by species affect ecosystem processes. One method is to estimate functional diversity (FD) based on the dispersion of species in functional trait space. Individuals within a species also differ, however, and an unresolved challenge is how to include such intraspecific variability in a measure of functional diversity. Our solution is to extend an existing measure to variation among individuals within species. Here, simulations demonstrate how the new measure behaves relative to one that does not include individual variation. Individual-level FD was less well associated with species richness than species-level FD in a single trait dimension, because species differed in their intraspecific variation. However, in multiple trait dimensions, there was a strong association between individual- and species-level FD and richness, because many traits result in a tight relationship between functional diversity and species richness. The correlation between the two FD measures weakened as the amount of intraspecific variability increased. Analyzing natural plant communities we found no relationship between species richness and functional diversity. In these analyses, we did not have to specify the source of intraspecific variation. In fact, the variation was only among individuals. The measure can, however, include differences in the amount of intraspecific variation at different sites, as we demonstrate. Including intraspecific variation should allow a more complete understanding of the processes that link individuals and ecosystems and provide better predictions about the consequences of extinctions for ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Intraspecific trait variability is a crucial, often neglected, component of functional diversity (FD) in ecological communities. In particular, uncertainty remains as to the importance of intraspecific variability in the quantification of FD. 2. To explore this uncertainty, we propose two methods addressing two critical and complementary, but largely unexplored, questions: (i) what is the extent of within- vs. between-species FD in different communities? and (ii) to what extent is the response of FD to environment because of compositional turnover vs. intraspecific trait variability across habitats? The methods proposed to address these questions are built on a variance partitioning approach and have the advantage of including species relative abundance, therefore taking into account species dominance and rarity. For each of the questions, we illustrate one dedicated case study in semi-natural grasslands with associated sampling strategies. 3. The decomposition of total community variance into within- vs. between-species effects can be implemented in a manner similar to the decomposition of quadratic entropy on pairwise individual dissimilarity. The approach can be applied with single and multiple traits, although it proves more informative for single traits. It can prove particularly useful when assessing the role of different sources of trait variability in the assembly of communities. 4. The assessment of the relative contribution of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover to the response of FD to environment is based on a variance partitioning comparing FD indices computed (i) either using individuals measured in a specific habitat alone (FDhabitat) or (ii) all individuals measured across different habitats (FDfixed). This approach provides a more complete understanding of the response of FD to environment. 5. We further propose a guide to apply these two methods and to choose the most suitable method for intraspecific trait measurements. Assessing the role of intraspecific trait variability should allow a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that link species and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Though many processes are involved in determining which species coexist and assemble into communities, competition is among the best studied. One hypothesis about competition's contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

@article{Kichenin2013,
abstract = {1. Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly. 2. Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant commu- nities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and sub- ordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and commu- nity-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. 3. By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradi- ent, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assem- blages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abun- dance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P con- centrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. 4. The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. 5. The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspe- cific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and high- lights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in commu- nity-level processes},

@book{Murphy2012,
abstract = {Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists often need to simultaneously evaluate the significance of multiple related hypotheses. Multiple comparisons need to be corrected to avoid inappropriately increasing the number of null hypotheses that are wrongly rejected. The traditional method of correction involves Bonferroni-type multiple comparison procedures which are highly conservative, tending to increase the number of wrong rejections of true hypotheses as the number of hypotheses being simultaneously tested increases. 2. Newer procedures which are based on False Discovery Rates and which do not suffer the same loss of power as traditional methods are described. Algorithms and spreadsheet-based software routines for three procedures which are especially useful in ecology and evolution are provided. 3. The strengths and potential pitfalls of FDR-based analysis and of presenting results as FDR-adjusted P-values are discussed with reference to traditional methods such as the sequential Bonferroni correction. 4. FDR-based multiple comparison procedures should be more widely adopted because they are often more appropriate than traditional methods for identifying truly significant results.},

abstract = {1. Plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects have almost exclusively been quantified on homogeneous soils, but as different plant species will influence their local soil differently in reality PSF effects will be spatially heterogeneous. Whether plant performance in soils with spatially heterogeneous PSF can be predicted from pot experiments with homogeneous soils is unclear. 2. In a greenhouse experiment we tested the response of monocultures of six grassland species (two grasses, two legumes, and two forbs) to three spatially explicit treatments (fine-grain heterogeneity, coarse-grain heterogeneity, and homogeneous). Sixteen patches of conditioned soil ({\~{}}6x6 cm) were placed within each container. For homogeneous treatments all patches contained the same conditioned soil within a container. The fine-grained heterogeneous treatment contained four differently conditioned soils that were applied following a Latin square design, while for the coarse-grained heterogeneous treatment four contiguous square blocks of four cells each were created in each container. 3. In general species grew worse on soil conditioned by conspecifics. However, when the biomass production on all homogeneous soil treatments (own and foreign soils) was averaged and compared to the heterogeneous treatments, we found that biomass production was lower than expected in the heterogeneous soils. This effect of heterogeneity depended on both the conditioning and test species, but most heterogeneity effects were negative. The grain of the heterogeneity (coarse vs. fine: at the chosen spatial scale) did not affect plant performance. 4. We hypothesize that a more diverse soil community is present in spatially heterogeneous soils. This increases i) the chance of plants to encounter its antagonists, which may then rapidly increase in numbers; and ii) the scope for synergistic co-infections. Together this may lead to non-additive responses of plants to spatial heterogeneity in PSF. 5. Synthesis. Plant performance was lower in spatially heterogeneous soils than predicted by spatially homogeneous soils. In natural grasslands that have mixed plant communities conditioning the soil plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects on plant performance may therefore be more negative than what is predicted from pot experiments. Our results emphasise the need to incorporate the spatial dynamics of PSF both in empirical and modelling studies if we are to understand the role of PSF in plant-plant interactions and plant community dynamics.},

abstract = {Because many species have not been described and most species ranges have not been mapped, conservation planners often use surrogates for conservation planning, but evidence for surrogate effectiveness is weak. Surrogates are well-mapped features such as soil types, landforms, occurrences of an easily observed taxon (discrete surrogates), and well-mapped environmental conditions (continuous surrogate). In the context of reserve selection, the idea is that a set of sites selected to span diversity in the surrogate will efficiently represent most species. Environmental diversity (ED) is a rarely used surrogate that selects sites to efficiently span multivariate ordination space. Because it selects across continuous environmental space, ED should perform better than discrete surrogates (which necessarily ignore within-bin and between-bin heterogeneity). Despite this theoretical advantage, ED appears to have performed poorly in previous tests of its ability to identify 50 × 50 km cells that represented vertebrates in Western Europe. Using an improved implementation of ED, we retested ED on Western European birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and combined terrestrial vertebrates. We also tested ED on data sets for plants of Zimbabwe, birds of Spain, and birds of Arizona (United States). Sites selected using ED represented European mammals no better than randomly selected cells, but they represented species in the other 7 data sets with 20{\%} to 84{\%} effectiveness. This far exceeds the performance in previous tests of ED, and exceeds the performance of most discrete surrogates. We believe ED performed poorly in previous tests because those tests considered only a few candidate explanatory variables and used suboptimal forms of ED's selection algorithm. We suggest future work on ED focus on analyses at finer grain sizes more relevant to conservation decisions, explore the effect of selecting the explanatory variables most associated with species turnover, and investigate whether nonclimate abiotic variables can provide useful surrogates in an ED framework.},

abstract = {A major aim of including the spatial component in ecological studies is to characterize the nature and intensity of spatial relationships between organisms and their environ- ment. The growing awareness by ecologists of the importance of including spatial structure in ecological studies (for hypothesis development, experimental design, statistical analyses, and spatial modeling) is beneficial because it promotes more effective research. Unfortunately, as more researchers perform spatial analysis, some misconceptions about the virtues of spatial statistics have been carried through the process and years. Some of these statistical concepts and challenges were already presented by Cliff and Ord in 1969. Here, we classify the most common misconcep- tions about spatial autocorrelation into three categories of challenges: (1) those that have no solutions, (2) those where solutions exist but are not well known, and (3) those where solutions have been proposed but are incorrect.We conclude in stressing where new research is needed to address these challenges.

Spatial autocorrelation is indeed a problem in standard inferential statistics, which was developed to handle controlled experiments, when these methods are used to generalize from natural experiments. From the perspective of geographic information science, however, spatial dependence is a defining characteristic of geographic data that makes many of the functions of geographic information systems possible. The almost universal presence of spatial heterogeneity in such data also argues against generalization and is made explicit in the recent development of place-based analytic techniques. The final section argues for a new approach to the teaching of quantitative methods in the environmental and social sciences that treats natural experiments, spatial dependence, and spatial heterogeneity as the norm},

abstract = {Aims Climate change can substantially alter ecological communities. However, we hypothesized that, even if novel communities emerge, those communities may not be novel in terms of functional composition. To infer the processes associated with rising temperatures, we evaluated elevational taxonomic/functional turnover of plant and invertebrate communities. Because climate change interacts synergistically with other environmental factors, and therefore is not the sole driver of change in ecological communities, we also considered how the taxonomic/functional composition of the communities would be affected by mammalian overgrazing/browsing, which has become prominent in the study region. Location Shiretoko National Park, Shiretoko Peninsular, Hokkaido, Japan. Methods We investigated the diversity of eight groups of organisms (taxa) in forests of northern Japan, and calculated the distance decay of taxonomic/functional similarity (S{\o}rensen's $\beta$-diversity) along an elevational gradient. A null model was used to separate functional turnover from taxonomic turnover. We then simulated how taxonomic/functional turnover along the gradient would be changed after non-random loss of species sensitive to mammalian herbivory. Results We found that each group showed elevational decay in taxonomic similarity. Along an elevational gradient, species groups structured by stronger dispersal limitation showed faster species turnover. This suggested differences in the process of climate-induced species reassembly among the groups. We also found that elevational turnover of communities based on functional traits tended to be lower than that based on taxonomic identity for the majority of the groups, supporting our hypothesis of functional redundancy across the elevational gradient. We thus speculated that climate-induced emergence of taxonomically novel communities may have limited influence on critical ecosystem processes supported by functional diversity. Furthermore, while random species loss did not change functional turnover, non-random loss of species attributable to mammalian herbivory substantially accelerated elevational functional turnover of the taxa. This suggested a possible loss of the functional redundancy of communities. Main conclusions Future communities may be novel not simply because climates are changing at unprecedented rates but also because of the synergetic influences of other environmental changes. Thus ecological processes may be more seriously affected in the future than is generally anticipated based on existing climate-change scenarios, with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of functional traits have received little attention in community ecology but have the potential to provide insights into the processes that structure communities. In this study, I used semivariograms to describe spatial patterns of functional traits and evaluate processes (niche differentiation, environmental filtering, and dispersal limitation) driving functional divergence in old-field plant communities. I collected spatially explicit data on key plant functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area [SLA], and leaf dry matter content [LDMC]) and environmental variables (soil depth and soil moisture) across a range of spatial scales ({\textless} 1–1500 m) in old fields in central New York. All traits displayed nonrandom spatial patterns consistent with the environmental filtering hypothesis, but patterns differed among traits. Height had strong spatial dependence at scales congruent with spatial heterogeneity of soil depth, indicating that soil depth acted as a spatial template for divergence in height. SLA and LDMC had much weaker spatial dependence, with {\textgreater} 90{\%} of total divergence occurring within 1-m2 plots, demonstrating that high levels of functional divergence may occur at very fine spatial scales. Spatial patterns of intraspecific functional divergence differed among four common species (Solidago canadensis, Bromus inermis, Poa pratensis and Galium mollugo), indicating that species differed in their trait responses to environmental variation. This study provides novel descriptions of spatial patterns of functional traits in plant communities and demonstrates how these patterns can help understand the processes driving functional divergence across spatial scales.},

Although species richness in these plots was close to its theoretical maximum, we found that it was frequently lower than null expectation. This was a result of slightly clumped distributions within species.

In this study, we argue that more attention should be paid to local processes and the responses of species along soil gradients, as habitat destruction and change in terms of an altered edaphic environment are the main factors behind the decline of many plant species in Central Europe. Examples from deciduous forests and calcareous dry grasslands show that response optima and especially response limits relative to soil pH and phosphorus availability are more closely related to the range sizes and threat levels of species than the traditionally applied Ellenberg indicator values, and that species assumed to have similar preferences show considerable, ecologically relevant differences in their thresholds. There is an urgent need for collecting more and better soil data and for analyzing the relationships between the spatial distribution of plant species and edaphic variables on regional and local scales, in order to identify optimal and marginal habitats of species as a pre-requisite for their successful conservation.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal changes in community structure of soil organisms may result from a myriad of processes operating at a hierarchy of spatial scales, from small-scale habitat conditions to species movements among patches and large-sale landscape features. To disentangle the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors at different scales (plot, patch and landscape), we analyzed changes in Collembola community structure along a gradient of forest fragmentation, testing predictions of the Hierarchical Patch Dynamics Paradigm (HPDP) in different European biogeographic regions (Boreal, Continental, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Alpine). Using variance partitioning methods, based on partial CCAs, we observed that the independent effect of environmental processes was significantly explaining Collembola community variance in all regions, while the relative effect of spatial variables was not significant, due to the observed high levels of landscape heterogeneity along the gradient. Environmental factors at the patch and plot scales were generally significant and explained the larger part of community changes. Landscape variables were not significant across all study sites. Yet, at the landscape level, an increase in forest habitat and proximity of forest patches were showed to have an indirect influence on local community changes, by influencing microhabitat heterogeneity at lower spatial scales in all studied regions. In line with HPDP, large-scale landscape features influenced spatio-temporal changes in soil fauna communities by constraining small-scale environmental processes. In turn, these provided mechanistic understanding for diversity patterns operating at the patch scale, via shifts in community weighted mean of Collembola life-forms occurring in local communities along the fragmentation gradient.},

abstract = {Question: What are the trends and patterns in the application of ordination techniques in vegetation science since 1990? Location: Worldwide literature analysis. Methods: Evaluation of five major journals of vegetation science; search of all ISI-listed ecological journals. Data were analysed with ANCOVAs, Spearman rank correlations, GLMs, biodiversity indices and simple graphs. Results: The ISI search retrieved fewer papers that used ordinations than the manual evaluation of five selected journals. Both retrieval methods revealed a clear trend in increasing frequency of ordination applications from 1990 to the present. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was far more frequently detected by the ISI search than any other method. Applications such as Correspondence Analysis/Reciprocal Averaging and Detrended Correspondence Analysis have increasingly been used in studies published in “applied” journals, while Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Redundancy Analysis and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling were more frequently used in journals focusing on more “basic” research. Overall, Detrended Correspondence Analysis was the most commonly applied method within the five major journals, although the number of publications slightly decreased over time. Use of Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling has increased over the last 10 years. Conclusion: The availability of suitable software packages has facilitated the application of certain techniques such as Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling. However, choices of ordination techniques are currently less driven by the constraints imposed by the software; there is also limited evidence that the choice of methods follows social considerations such as the need to use fashionable methods. Methodological diversity has been maintained or has even increased over time and reflects the researcher's need for diverse analytical tools suitable to address a wide range of questions.},

abstract = {A critical part of ecological studies is to quantify how landscape spatial heterogeneity affects species' distributions. With advancements in remote sensing technology and GIS, we now live in a data-rich era allowing us to investigate species–environment relationships in heterogeneous landscapes at multiple spatial scales. However, the degree and type of spatial heterogeneity changes depending on the spatial scale at which species–environment relationships are analysed. Here we present the current spatial analytic methods used in ecological studies to quantify ecological spatial heterogeneity. To determine the key spatial scales at which underlying ecological processes act upon species, we recommend use of spectral decomposition techniques such as wavelet analysis or Moran's eigenvector maps. Following this, a suite of spatial regression methods can be used to quantify the relative influence of environmental factors on species' distributions. Finally, spatial graph metrics can be employed to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on landscape connectivity across or within species' ranges and can be used as additional predictors in spatial regression models. We emphasize how spatial statistics, spatial regression, and spatial graph theory can be used to provide insights into how landscape spatial complexity influences species distributions and to better understand species response to global change.},

Long-standing theory suggests that soil organic matter is composed of inherently stable and chemically unique compounds. Here we argue that the available evidence does not support the formation of large-molecular-size and persistent ‘humic substances' in soils. Instead, soil organic matter is a continuum of progressively decomposing organic compounds. We discuss implications of this view of the nature of soil organic matter for aquatic health, soil carbon–climate interactions and land management.},

@article{Cushman2004,
abstract = {Multi-scale investigations of species-environment relationships are an important tool in ecological research. The scale at which independent and dependent variables are measured, and how they are coded for analysis, can strongly influence the relationships that are discovered. However, little is known about how the coding of the dependent variable set influences community-level analyses. In this study, we used canonical correspondence analysis to quantify species-environment relationships between environmental factors collected at three spatial scales and the structure of a forest bird community in the Oregon coast range. The main question in our analysis was how coding the bird data as abundance versus presence/absence affected the nature and strength of observed relationships. As we expected, the structure of the bird community was better described overall using abundance data than it was using presence/absence data. However, individual species and life-history groups appeared to exhibit different species-environment relationships in abundance versus presence/absence data. In particular, common species with a high frequency of occurrence among sample points exhibited a stronger ‘abundance' signature, whereas uncommon species with a low frequency of occurrence exhibited a stronger ‘presence/absence' signature. In addition, the apparent importance of plot-level factors in explaining the variation in the bird community was greater for abundance data, whereas patch and landscape factors were more important in the presence/absence data. Thus, conclusions about the relative importance of factors at different scales is largely contingent on the way in which the species-response data are coded for analysis. For communities as a whole, and for individual species within them, the strength and nature of species-environment relationships can differ dramatically between analyses using presence/absence versus abundance data},

@article{Wagner2003,
abstract = {Spatial structure in plant communities occurs in the forms of (1) single-species aggregation and dispersion patterns, (2) distance-dependent interactions between species, and (3) the response to the spatial structure of environmental conditions. Different methods deal with these components of spatial variation: geostatistical analysis reveals autocorrelation in a spatial sample; the variance of species richness has been used as an indicator for interspecific interactions due to niche limitation; and ordination techniques describe multispecies responses to environmental factors. Based on the mathematical properties of presence-absence data, it is shown how variogram modeling, the testing of interspecific associations, and multiscale ordination can be integrated using the same set of distance-dependent variance-covariance matrices (variogram matrix). The variogram matrix partitions the variance of community data into spatial components at the levels of the individual species, species composition, and species richness. It can be used to factor out the effects of single-species aggregation patterns, interspecific interactions, or environmental heterogeneity. The mathematical integration of traditionally unrelated methods increases the interpretability of variograms of plant communities, provides a spatial extension and an empirical null model for the variance test of species richness, and extends multiscale ordination to nonsystematic spatial samples. Beyond the individual applications, the variogram matrix provides a framework for a mathematical unification of geostatistics, multivariate data analysis, and the analysis of variance that may enable ecologists from a broad range of fields to incorporate spatial effects into their research and to integrate analyses across different levels of biological organization.},

abstract = {* Shipley, Vile {\&} Garnier (Science 2006; 314: 812) proposed a maximum entropy approach to studying how species relative abundance is mediated by their traits, ‘community assembly via trait selection' (CATS). * In this paper, we build on recent equivalences between the maximum entropy formalism and Poisson regression to show that CATS is equivalent to a generalized linear model for abundance, with species traits as predictor variables. * Main advantages gained by access to the machinery of generalized linear models can be summarized as advantages in interpretation, model checking, extensions and inference. * A more difficult issue, however, is the development of valid methods of inference for single-site data, as species correlation in abundance is not accounted for in CATS (whether specified as a regression or via maximum entropy). This issue can be circumvented for multisite data using design-based inference. * These points are illustrated by example – our plant abundances were found to violate the implicit Poisson assumption of CATS, but a negative binomial regression had much improved fit, and our model was extended to multisite data in order to directly model the environment–trait interaction. Violations of the Poisson assumption were strong and accounting for them qualitatively changed results, presumably because larger counts had undue influence when overdispersion had not been accounted for. We advise that future CATS analysts routinely check for overdispersion and account for it if present.},

There are ca. 15 patterns consisting of the frequency distributions of the variables, variables as a function of area or sample size, and interrelationships between variables that appear to be very general if not close to universal. A number of links can be drawn between these patterns. In particular, I show that local communities can be seen as random samples of the regional pool, but only as a special form of sampling that is autocorrelated due to the spatial clumping of individuals within a species. I describe two distinct sets of mathematical machinery that can start with the regional species abundance distribution and then predict local species richness, local species abundance distributions, and $\beta$-diversity (in the form of species area relationships or decay of similarity with distance). I conclude by examining some of the implications of the fact that biodiversity patterns are linked by autocorrelated sampling.},

abstract = {* The $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\gamma$-diversity decomposition methodology is commonly used to investigate changes in diversity over space or time but rarely conjointly. However, with the ever-increasing availability of large-scale biodiversity monitoring data, there is a need for a sound methodology capable of simultaneously accounting for spatial and temporal changes in diversity.


* Using the properties of Chao's index, we adapted Rao's framework of diversity decomposition between orthogonal dimensions to a multiplicative $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\gamma$-decomposition of functional or phylogenetic diversity over space and time, thereby combining their respective properties. We also developed guidelines for interpreting both temporal and spatial $\beta$-diversities and their interaction.


* We characterized the range of $\beta$-diversity estimates and their relationship to the nested decomposition of diversity. Using simulations, we empirically demonstrated that temporal and spatial $\beta$-diversities are independent from each other and from $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-diversities when the study design is balanced, but not otherwise. Furthermore, we showed that the interaction term between the temporal and the spatial $\beta$-diversities lacked such properties.


* We illustrated our methodology with a case study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of functional diversity in bird assemblages in four regions of France. Based on these data, our method makes it possible to discriminate between regions experiencing different diversity changes in time. Our methodology may therefore be valuable for comparing diversity changes over space and time using large-scale data sets of repeated surveys.},

The package was designed to be extremely flexible, to allow users to simulate their own defined species–environment relationships, as well as to provide a fine control over every simulation parameter. The package also includes a function to generate random virtual species distributions.

abstract = {Considerable debate focuses on whether invasive species establish and become abundant by being functionally and phylogenetically distinct from native species, leading to a host of invasion-specific hypotheses of community assembly. Few studies, however, have quantitatively assessed whether similar patterns of phylogenetic and functional similarity explain local abundance of both native and introduced species, which would suggest similar assembly mechanisms regardless of origin. Using a chronosequence of invaded temperate forest stands, we tested whether the occurrence and abundance of both introduced and native species were predicted by phylogenetic relatedness, functional overlap, and key environmental characteristics including forest age. Environmental filtering against functionally and phylogenetically distinct species strongly dictated the occurrence and abundance of both introduced and native species, with slight modifications of these patterns according to forest age. Thus, once functional and evolutionary novelty were quantified, introduced status provided little information about species' presence or abundance, indicating largely similar sorting mechanisms for both native and introduced species.},

abstract = {Biodiversity macroecology deals with the commonly measured variables of abundance, distribution, occupancy, and range size across two scales: the local (or $\alpha$) and regional ($\gamma$). There are ca. 15 patterns consisting of the frequency distributions of the variables, variables as a function of area or sample size, and interrelationships between variables that appear to be very general if not close to universal. A number of links can be drawn between these patterns. In particular, I show that local communities can be seen as random samples of the regional pool, but only as a special form of sampling that is autocorrelated due to the spatial clumping of individuals within a species. I describe two distinct sets of mathematical machinery that can start with the regional species abundance distribution and then predict local species richness, local species abundance distributions, and $\beta$-diversity (in the form of species area relationships or decay of similarity with distance). I conclude by examining some of the implications of the fact that biodiversity patterns are linked by autocorrelated sampling.},

abstract = {Aim To assess the degree of fine-scale environmental determinism in fern community composition in a diverse, mid-montane tropical forest, and to test whether species local microhabitat distributions are linked to their elevational ranges regionally. Location Tunquini biological station, eastern Bolivian Andes. Methods We recorded fern species composition and environmental descriptors in two montane forest transects on opposite valley slopes at c. 1650 m elevation. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were run to examine how much floristic variation was explained by spatial and environmental (soil, forest structural, topoclimatic) variables. We then linked species local environmental distributions, as evidenced in these analyses, to their elevational ranges in Bolivia using herbarium data. Results There was a striking floristic difference between the transects, attributable to differences in exposure, temperature and humidity. Environmental and floristic variation were also strongly linked within transects, with soil variation being most important. The overlap between spatially and environmentally explained variation was high, but there was congruence in the main environmental predictors selected in both transects, suggesting considerable spatial structure arose from species responses to a patchy environment. Species local microclimatic distributions were significantly linked to their regional elevational ranges. Species associated with the drier north-easterly transect had average range mid-points and maxima significantly higher (by 211 m and 402 m, respectively) than those associated with the more humid south-westerly transect. Within transects, species associated with more acidic soils and warmer microsites had higher average range minima, mid-points or maxima (by {\textgreater} 200 m in all cases) than those associated with less acidic and cooler microsites. Main conclusions Strong environmental determinism of community composition was apparent in relation to both local topoclimatic and soil gradients. Moreover, our results suggest that fine-scale variation in environmental conditions enhances the mixing of lowland and highland floras in mid-montane forests, thereby contributing to mid-elevation diversity.},

abstract = {* The Mantel test is widely used in biology, including landscape ecology and genetics, to detect spatial structures in data or control for spatial correlation in the relationship between two data sets, for example community composition and environment. The study demonstrates that this is an incorrect use of that test. * The null hypothesis of the Mantel test differs from that of correlation analysis; the statistics computed in the two types of analyses differ. We examined the basic assumptions of the Mantel test in spatial analysis and showed that they are not verified in most studies. We showed the consequences, in terms of power, of the mismatch between these assumptions and the Mantel testing procedure. * The Mantel test H0 is the absence of relationship between values in two dissimilarity matrices, not the independence between two random variables or data tables. The Mantel R2 differs from the R2 of correlation, regression and canonical analysis; these two statistics cannot be reduced to one another. Using simulated data, we show that in spatial analysis, the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity of the Mantel test (H1: small values of D1 correspond to small values of D2 and large values of D1 to large values of D2) do not hold in most cases, except when spatial correlation extends over the whole study area. Using extensive simulations of spatially correlated data involving different representations of geographic relationships, we show that the power of the Mantel test is always lower than that of distance-based Moran's eigenvector map (dbMEM) analysis and that the Mantel R2 is always smaller than in dbMEM analysis, and uninterpretable. These simulation results are novel contributions to the Mantel debate. We also show that regression on a geographic distance matrix does not remove the spatial structure from response data and does not produce spatially uncorrelated residuals. * Our main conclusion is that Mantel tests should be restricted to questions that, in the domain of application, only concern dissimilarity matrices, and are not derived from questions that can be formulated as the analysis of the vectors and matrices from which one can compute dissimilarity matrices.},

abstract = {Macroecology proceeds by identifying patterns and then identifying processes that cause those patterns. Most of the processes that macroecologists study are local in nature and tend to involve species interactions and speciation and extinction processes. In contrast, we propose that several important macroecological patterns can be explained by very large-scale processes that are primarily spatial in nature. Specifically, we suggest that the structure of abundance across a species' entire range combined with interspecific patterns in range location and global abundance can explain the well-known macroecological patterns of: (1) a positive correlation between range size and abundance, (2) the species-area relationship, (3) decay of species similarity with distance and (4) the species abundance distribution. We show that spatial processes produce these patterns through a combination of analytical and Monte Carlo analysis. We also show that the connection is robust (indifferent) to the precise mathematical assumptions. Such a theory might be called a unified theory, because it explains multiple patterns with a few processes. To differentiate among the growing number of unified theories, we suggest that testing additional predictions over and above producing curves of the correct shape is important. To this end, we present several novel, quantitative predictions and provide empirical tests. In short, we provide an empirically grounded and tested theory, which suggests that superimposing individual species ranges across space creates local community patterns.},

abstract = {The continuum hypothesis states that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of ecological communities. However, the contextual dependency of these processes remains an open question that imposes strong limitations on predictions of community responses to environmental change. Here we measure community and habitat turnover across multiple vertical soil horizons at 183 sites across Scotland for bacteria and fungi, both dominant and functionally vital components of all soils but which differ substantially in their growth habit and dispersal capability. We find that habitat turnover is the primary driver of bacterial community turnover in general, although its importance decreases with increasing isolation and disturbance. Fungal communities, however, exhibit a highly stochastic assembly process, both neutral and non-neutral in nature, largely independent of disturbance. These findings suggest that increased focus on dispersal limitation and biotic interactions are necessary to manage and conserve the key ecosystem services provided by these assemblages.},

abstract = {* 1The relative importance of niche- and dispersal-mediated processes in structuring diverse tropical plant communities remains poorly understood. Here, we link mesoscale beta diversity to soil variation throughout a lowland Bornean watershed underlain by alluvium, sedimentary and granite parent materials (c. 340 ha, 8–200 m a.s.l.). We test the hypothesis that species turnover across the habitat gradient reflects interspecific partitioning of soil resources. * 2Floristic inventories (≥ 1 cm d.b.h.) of the Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant Bornean canopy tree family, were combined with extensive soil analyses in 30 (0.16 ha) plots. Six samples per plot were analysed for total C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg, extractable P, texture, and pH. * 3Extractable P, exchangeable K, and total C, N and P varied significantly among substrates and were highest on alluvium. Thirty-one dipterocarp species (n = 2634 individuals, five genera) were recorded. Dipterocarp density was similar across substrates, but richness and diversity were highest on nutrient-poor granite and lowest on nutrient-rich alluvium. * 4Eighteen of 22 species were positively or negatively associated with parent material. In 8 of 16 abundant species, tree distribution (≥ 10 cm d.b.h.) was more strongly non-random than juveniles (1–10 cm d.b.h.), suggesting higher juvenile mortality in unsuitable habitats. The dominant species Dipterocarpus sublamellatus ({\textgreater} 50{\%} of stems) was indifferent to substrate, but nine of 11 ‘subdominant' species ({\textgreater} 8 individuals ha−1) were substrate specialists. * 5Eighteen of 22 species were significantly associated with soil nutrients, especially P, Mg and Ca. Floristic variation was significantly correlated with edaphic and geographical distance for all stems ≥ 1 cm d.b.h. in Mantel analyses. However, juvenile variation (1–10 cm d.b.h.) was more strongly related to geographical distance than edaphic factors, while the converse held for established trees (≥ 10 cm d.b.h.), suggesting increased importance of niche processes with size class. * 6Pervasive dipterocarp associations with soil factors suggest that niche partitioning structures dipterocarp tree communities. Yet, much floristic variation unrelated to soil was correlated with geographical distance between plots, suggesting that dispersal and niche processes jointly determine mesoscale beta diversity in the Bornean Dipterocarpaceae.},

@article{Fattorini2016,
abstract = {We examine whether Species Abundance Distribution models (SADs) and diversity indices can describe how species colonization status influences species community assembly on oceanic islands. Our hypothesis is that, because of the lack of source-sink dynamics at the archipelago scale, Single Island Endemics (SIEs), i.e. endemic species restricted to only one island, should be represented by few rare species and consequently have abundance patterns that differ from those of more widespread species. To test our hypothesis, we used arthropod data from the Azorean archipelago (North Atlantic). We divided the species into three colonization categories: SIEs, archipelagic endemics (AZEs, present in at least two islands) and native non-endemics (NATs). For each category, we modelled rank-abundance plots using both the geometric series and the Gambin model, a measure of distributional amplitude. We also calculated Shannon entropy and Buzas and Gibson's evenness. We show that the slopes of the regression lines modelling SADs were significantly higher for SIEs, which indicates a relative predominance of a few highly abundant species and a lack of rare species, which also depresses diversity indices. This may be a consequence of two factors: (i) some forest specialist SIEs may be at advantage over other, less adapted species; (ii) the entire populations of SIEs are by definition concentrated on a single island, without possibility for inter-island source-sink dynamics; hence all populations must have a minimum number of individuals to survive natural, often unpredictable, fluctuations. These findings are supported by higher values of the $\alpha$ parameter of the Gambin mode for SIEs. In contrast, AZEs and NATs had lower regression slopes, lower $\alpha$ but higher diversity indices, resulting from their widespread distribution over several islands. We conclude that these differences in the SAD models and diversity indices demonstrate that the study of these metrics is useful for biogeographical purposes.},

abstract = {Galileo wrote that "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics"; his quantitative approach to understanding the natural world arguably marks the beginning of modern science. Nearly 400 years later, the fragmented teaching of science in our universities still leaves biology outside the quantitative and mathematical culture that has come to define the physical sciences and engineering. This strikes us as particularly inopportune at a time when opportunities for quantitative thinking about biological systems are exploding. We propose that a way out of this dilemma is a unified introductory science curriculum that fully incorporates mathematics and quantitative thinking.},

@article{Kreft2010,
abstract = {Aim Biogeographical regionalizations, such as zoogeographical regions, floristic kingdoms or ecoregions, represent categorizations central to many basic and applied questions in biogeography, ecology, evolution and conservation. Traditionally established by experts based on qualitative evidence, the lack of transparency and quantitative support has set constraints on their utility. The recent availability of global species range maps, novel multivariate techniques and enhanced computational power now enable a quantitative scrutiny and extension of biogeographical regionalizations that will facilitate new and more rigorous uses. In this paper we develop and illustrate a methodological roadmap for species-level biogeographical regionalizations at the global scale and apply it to mammals. Location Global. Methods We explore the relative usefulness of ordination and clustering methods and validation techniques. The performance of nine different clustering algorithms is tested at different taxonomic levels. The grain of regionalization (i.e. the number of clusters) will usually be driven by the purpose of the study, but we present several approaches that provide guidance. Results Non-metric multidimensional scaling offers a valuable first step in identifying and illustrating biogeographical transition zones. For the clustering of regions, the nine different hierarchical clustering methods varied greatly in utility, with UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) agglomerative hierarchical clustering having consistently the best performance. The UPGMA approach allows a tree-like phenetic representation of the relative distances of regions and can be applied at different levels of taxonomic resolution. We find that the new quantitative biogeographical regions exhibit both striking similarities to and differences from the classic primary geographical divisions of the world's biota. Specifically, our results provide evidence that the Sahara, northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East should be regarded as part of the Afrotropics. Further, the position of the New Guinean continental shelf, Lydekker's Line, is supported as an appropriate border to separate the Oriental and Australian regions. Main conclusions We propose that this sort of new, quantitative delineation and relationship assessment across taxonomic and geographical grains is likely to offer opportunities for more rigorous inference in historical and ecological biogeography and conservation.},

@article{Loreau1999,
abstract = {Explaining the maintenance of high local species diversity in communities governed by competition for space has been a long-standing problem in ecology. We present a simple theoretical model to explore the influence of immigration from an external source on local coexistence, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem processes in plant communities. The model is built after classical metapopulation models but is applied to competition for space between individuals and includes immigration by a propagule rain and an extinction threshold for rare species. Our model shows that immigration can have a huge effect on local species diversity in competitive communities where competition for space would lead to the exclusion of all but one species if the community were closed. Local species richness is expected to increase strongly when immigration intensity increases beyond the threshold required for the successful establishment of one or a few individuals. Community structure and species relative abundances are also expected to change markedly with immigration intensity. Increasing immigration causes total space occupation by the community to increase but primary productivity on average to either decrease or stay constant with increasing diversity, depending on the relation between immigration and local reproduction rates. These results stress the need for a regional perspective to understand the processes that determine species diversity, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem functioning in local communities.},

To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},

abstract = {Aim To compare the fit of models of climate, habitat quality, neutral processes, and geometric constraints to species richness and composition of small mammal assemblages. Location The South American Atlantic Forest biome. Methods Using neutral models and mid-domain effect models, we simulated species spread in a spatially explicit array of grid cells representing the Atlantic Forest domain. We compared empirical patterns of species richness and composition with predictions of the neutral and mid-domain effect models. We also modeled individual species responses to climatic conditions and forest integrity, a measure of habitat quality. Results Habitat quality was the single best predictor of local species richness ($\alpha$-diversity), but was a poor predictor of local species composition and of the decay in species similarity with distance ($\beta$-diversity). The neutral and mid-domain models generated very similar predictions, and were better predictors of species composition than of species richness. Climate variables were also strongly associated with overall species composition, but not with species richness. Main Conclusions The species richness of small-mammal assemblages in the Atlantic Forest is best explained by variation in habitat quality. In contrast, the composition of small-mammal assemblages is best explained by models of limited dispersal (neutral and mid-domain) and effects of climate on local species composition. Collectively, these results suggest that regional patterns of species richness may be uncoupled from patterns of species composition. Both species richness and composition should be considered when evaluating the predictions of neutral and mid-domain effect models, and of correlations of community structure with climatic or habitat variables.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We analyze the relative contribution of environmental and spatial variables to the alpha and beta components of taxonomic (TD), phylogenetic (PD), and functional (FD) diversity in ant communities found along different climate and anthropogenic disturbance gradients across western and central Europe, in order to assess the mechanisms structuring ant biodiversity. To this aim we calculated alpha and beta TD, PD, and FD for 349 ant communities, which included a total of 155 ant species; we examined 10 functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness. Variation partitioning was used to examine how much variation in ant diversity was explained by environmental and spatial variables. Autocorrelation in diversity measures and each trait's phylogenetic signal were also analyzed. We found strong autocorrelation in diversity measures. Both environmental and spatial variables significantly contributed to variation in TD, PD, and FD at both alpha and beta scales; spatial structure had the larger influence. The different facets of diversity showed similar patterns along environmental gradients. Environment explained a much larger percentage of variation in FD than in TD or PD. All traits demonstrated strong phylogenetic signals. Our results indicate that environmental filtering and dispersal limitations structure all types of diversity in ant communities. Strong dispersal limitations appear to have led to clustering of TD, PD, and FD in western and central Europe, probably because different historical and evolutionary processes generated different pools of species. Remarkably, these three facets of diversity showed parallel patterns along environmental gradients. Trait-mediated species sorting and niche conservatism appear to structure ant diversity, as evidenced by the fact that more variation was explained for FD and that all traits had strong phylogenetic signals. Since environmental variables explained much more variation in FD than in PD, functional diversity should be a better indicator of community assembly processes than phylogenetic diversity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The relevance of neutral versus niche-based community assembly rules (i.e. the processes sorting species present in a larger geographical region into local commu- nities) remains to be demonstrated in ecology and biogeography. To attempt to do this, a number of complex null models are increasingly being used that compare observed community functional diversity (FD, i.e. the extent of trait dissimilarity between coexisting species) with randomly simulated FD.However, little is known about the performance of these null models in detecting non-neutral community assembly rules such as trait convergence and divergence of communities (suppos- edly revealing habitat selection and limiting similarity, respectively). Here, using both simulated and field communities, I show that assembly rule detection varies systematically with the magnitude of the observed FD, so that these null models do not really succeed in breaking down the observed functional relationships between species. This is a particular concern, making detection of community assembly dependent on: (1) the pool of samples considered, and (2) the capacity of observed FD to correctly discriminate these rules. Null models should be more thoroughly described and validated before being considered as a magic wand to reveal assembly patterns.},

abstract = {1 Spatial pattern analyses were used to generate hypotheses about the processes that shape the structure of a plant community in the Mojave Desert of North America, with a focus on the semi-shrub Ambrosia dumosa. We analysed spatial distributions and sizes of this species relative to other semi-shrubs, shrubs and annuals, and the relationships between spatial patterns and abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics. 2 The analyses were based on maps of sample plots placed along a transect spanning two adjacent geological substrates: aeolian sand and gravelly, sandy to loamy alluvium. Of these two substrates, sand supported higher total biomasses of Ambrosia and of all woody perennials, while alluvium supported on average higher biomasses of winter annuals. 3 Annuals and seedlings of Ambrosia were much more strongly aggregated with Ambrosia canopies on sand than on alluvium, suggesting that these small plants were more strongly facilitated by Ambrosia on sand than on alluvium. 4 Ambrosia semi-shrubs were spatially segregated on sand but aggregated on alluvium, and the degree of segregation on sand increased with the total above-ground biomass of Ambrosia per unit area, indicating that negative interactions between Ambrosia plants were stronger in more productive habitats. Canopy sizes of Ambrosia in all mapped plots increased with distance to the nearest conspecific neighbour, which suggests that neighbour interactions negatively affected plant sizes. 5 Ambrosia plants on sand were spatially aggregated with Acamptopappus sphaerocephalus semi-shrubs, suggesting that at least one of these species may benefit from the association. Ambrosia plants were spatially segregated from Larrea tridentata shrubs on both substrates, possibly due to negative effects of Larrea roots on Ambrosia roots reported in previous studies. 6 Subtle differences in substrate characteristics were correlated with strong differences in the spatial distribution of Ambrosia plants relative to their neighbours, which suggests that edaphic conditions may affect the spatial structure of the community by modifying complex positive and negative interactions between neighbouring plants.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

abstract = {Abiotic factors are considered strong drivers of species distribution and assemblages. Yet these spatial patterns are also influenced by biotic interactions. Accounting for competitors or facilitators may improve both the fit and the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs). We investigated the influence of a dominant species, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, on the distribution of 34 subordinate species in the tundra of northern Norway. We related SDM parameters of those subordinate species to their functional traits and their co-occurrence patterns with E. hermaphroditum across three spatial scales. By combining both approaches, we sought to understand whether these species may be limited by competitive interactions and/or benefit from habitat conditions created by the dominant species. The model fit and predictive power increased for most species when the frequency of occurrence of E. hermaphroditum was included in the SDMs as a predictor. The largest increase was found for species that 1) co-occur most of the time with E. hermaphroditum, both at large (i.e. 750 m) and small spatial scale (i.e. 2 m) or co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at large scale but not at small scale and 2) have particularly low or high leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Species that do not co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at the smallest scale are generally palatable herbaceous species with low LDMC, thus showing a weak ability to tolerate resource depletion that is directly or indirectly induced by E. hermaphroditum. Species with high LDMC, showing a better aptitude to face resource depletion and grazing, are often found in the proximity of E. hermaphroditum. Our results are consistent with previous findings that both competition and facilitation structure plant distribution and assemblages in the Arctic tundra. The functional and co-occurrence approaches used were complementary and provided a deeper understanding of the observed patterns by refinement of the pool of potential direct and indirect ecological effects of E. hermaphroditum on the distribution of subordinate species. Our correlative study would benefit being complemented by experimental approaches.},

Here, we address the utility of two forms of filtering the calibration data set (geographic and environmental) to reduce the effects of sampling bias. To do so we created a virtual species, projected its niche to the Iberian Peninsula and took samples from its binary geographic distribution using several biases. We then built models for various sample sizes after applying each of the filtering approaches. While geographic filtering did not improve discriminatory ability (and sometimes worsened it), environmental filtering consistently led to better models. Models made with few but climatically filtered points performed better than those made with many unfiltered (biased) points. Future research should address additional factors such as the complexity of the species' niche, strength of filtering, and ability to predict suitability (rather than focus purely on discrimination).},

abstract = {Identifying the main determinants of tropical marine biodiversity is essential for devising appropriate conservation measures mitigating the ongoing degradation of coral reef habitats. Based on a gridded distribution database and phylogenetic information, we compared the phylogenetic structure of assemblages for three tropical reef fish families (Labridae: wrasses, Pomacentridae: damselfishes and Chaetodontidae: butterflyfishes) using the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We then related these indices to contemporary and historical environmental conditions of coral reefs using spatial regression analyses. Higher levels of phylogenetic clustering were found for fish assemblages in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and more particularly when considering the NTI index. The phylogenetic structure of the Pomacentridae, and to a lower extent of the Chaeotodontidae and Labridae, was primarily associated with the location of refugia during the Quaternary period. Phylogenetic clustering in the IAA may partly result from vicariance events associated with coral reef fragmentation during the glacial periods of the Quaternary. Variation in the patterns among fish families further suggest that dispersal abilities may have interacted with past habitat availability in shaping the phylogenetic structure of tropical reef fish assemblages.},

Slow integration of explicit landscape heterogeneity into the metacommunity concept has both limited our understanding of how landscape–dispersal interactions shape metacommunity structure and constrained the practical relevance of metacommunity theory. In this study, we encourage integration by developing an approach that characterizes how multiple landscape elements simultaneously contribute to metacommunity structure. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by characterizing how landscape heterogeneity shapes metacommunity structure of lizards at multiple spatial scales in the Mescalero Sands. We found diversity and spatial configuration of habitats in the surrounding landscape matrix best explained the pattern of nested subsets with clumped species loss observed in this lizard metacommunity across scales. Although our analyses included connectivity metrics for focal habitats, they were not shown to be important at any scale in this study. Our results were consistent with mass effects models of metacommunity theory as interpreted through landscape contrast. By integrating explicit landscape heterogeneity into the metacommunity framework, our approach provided a spatially explicit description of how and where landscape–dispersal interactions shaped metacommunity structure across scales and is directly applicable to many systems, especially those with indistinct boundaries. Our approach complements other analytical methods designed to tease apart relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial structure in metacommunity data. Finally, our approach enhances the practical relevance of metacommunity theory for future research in ecosystems subject to increasing landscape contrast as environments continue to be fragmented, habitats become further degraded and homogenized, and matrix habitats become more inhospitable.},

"the match between pattern and process is far from perfect, because changes in process intensity can create different patterns, and because several different processes can generate the same" (Fortin and Dale 2005:19)

"pattern signature (Figure 1.2 )." (Fortin and Dale 2005:20)

"Indeed, a spatial pattern is usually 'a single realization' or 'snapshot' of a process or of a combination of processes at one given time (Fortin et al. 2003 )." (Fortin and Dale 2005:21)

"Furthermore, our perception of the spatial structure of an area is directly related, and limited, to both the study area or 'extent' and sampling unit size or 'grain' at which we analyse it (Wiens 1989 )." (Fortin and Dale 2005:21)

"The physical distances that determine local vs. global can be very different depending on the system studied; just as 'landscape' is a level of organization with the distance encompassed determined by the organism of interest: beetle vs. coyote." (Fortin and Dale 2005:21)

"The components that affect our ability to identify spatial patterns and their underlying processes accurately are numerous, but they can be organized into three main categories (Figure 1.4; Dungan et al. 2002): (1) the extent of spatial expression of the processes themselves; (2) the sampling design used to measure ecological data (sample vs. population data; local vs. global level); and (3) the statistical tools used to characterize the spatial pattern of either the entire sampling area (i.e. global spatial statistics) or each sampling location (i.e. local spatial statistics)." (Fortin and Dale 2005:21)

"Several factors can act at the same time, interacting either additively when the factors are linear, or multiplicatively or otherwise when the factors are non-linear." (Fortin and Dale 2005:23)

"These spatial patterns usually result from a mixture of both exogenous ('induced') and endogenous ('inherent') processes acting on species spatial structure resulting in spatial dependence among individual organisms (e.g. plants)." (Fortin and Dale 2005:23)

"Here, the term 'spatial dependence' is used broadly to include a mix of both the species' response to the underlying (exogenous) processes and the species' spatial autocorrelation due to endogenous processes." (Fortin and Dale 2005:25)

"Various types of internal and external processes can create anisotropic pattern: topography, gradients (e.g. brousse tigr ́e e; see Chapter 2 ; Lejeune {\&} Tlidi 1999 ; Wu et al. 2000 ), stream and riparian strips, etc. Anisotropic spatial patterns can appear as artefacts of the shape of the sampling units used to collect the data as will be discussed in more detail in Section 1.4.2 (cf. Fortin 1999a )." (Fortin and Dale 2005:26)

"In other words, the parameters of the process, such as the mean and the variance, should be the same in all parts of the study area and in all directions. This assumption of stationarity is equivalent to the assumption of the independence of the observations for parametric statistics, implying that the data follow a known distribution and are homoscedastic." (Fortin and Dale 2005:27)

"From the plot to the landscape level, the inherent stationarity of the process needs to be ensured to avoid distorting spatial pattern identification and incorrect ecological interpretations." (Fortin and Dale 2005:29)

"Spatial statistics, summarizing the spatial pattern for the entire study area with a single number, should not be applied to a study area with non-stationary processes. Instead, 'local spatial statistics' should be used to estimate the spatial pattern for each sampling location (Boots 2002 ; T able 1.1 ). Only when stationary processes prevail in all the study area, can spatial statistics be used to characterize the study area with a single value (see Tables 1.2 and 1.3 ; Appendices 1 and 2 ). In such cases, they are referred to as 'global spatial statistics' to stress the fact that the statistics are considered valid for the entire area (Table 1.1 ). In this book, global spatial statistics will be referred to loosely as 'spatial statistics'; local statistics will be designated explicitly." (Fortin and Dale 2005:29)

"In general, if there is a choice of sampling unit size we suggest that a smaller sampling unit should be favoured because small units can be aggregated into larger ones without the loss of information, but the reverse is not true." (Fortin and Dale 2005:36)

"For example, we could be interested in the relationship, and potential causality, between soil moisture and plant growth." (Fortin and Dale 2005:42)

"As illustrated in Figure 1.16 a , both variables have a spatial structure based on multiple regression using the x and y coordinates of the sampling locations as independent variables. The relationship between the two variables (Figure 1.16 b ) is, however, only strong and significant when the raw data are used (left panel) but not when the spatially detrended data (residual data where the spatial structures are modelled by multiple regression) are used (right panel). This exercise clearly shows that before claiming causality between two ecological variables, we should test whether they have significant spatial structure. In the present case, the spatial structure is due to the spatial dependence of both variables on the slope from which the samples were obtained. This may be an example of spurious correlation. If the residuals from the multiple regressions still have some degree of spatial pattern, the ecological v ariables could have been both spatially dependent at one spatial scale and spatially autocorrelated at another. Thus, it is important to define the spatial scale of the question asked adequately so that the appropriate spatial statistics can be used adequately." (Fortin and Dale 2005:42)

"When using equidistant classes, one can select the distance interval instead of the number of distance classes. The minimum distance interval must be equal to or larger than the sampling unit length (or the longest side length in the case of a rectangular sampling unit)." (Fortin and Dale 2005:132)

"As stressed in Chapter 1, spatial patterns (i.e. lack of independence among data at nearby locations) are often the result of several processes. Consequently, the observed spatial structure is a mix of both induced spatial dependence (i.e. variable response to the spatial structure of exogenous process) and inherent spatial autocorrelation (i.e. inherent in the ecological process of the variable of interest). In fact, most of the time, it is difficult to disentangle them. The first spatial statistics were developed to estimate the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the data. Through the years it became more and more obvious that spatial autocorrelation coefficients, presented in this section, actually estimate the degree of spatial dependence (i.e. induced spatial dependence and inherent spatial autocorrelation). Hence, although we are going to use the term 'spatial autocorrelation' in this section, keep in mind that spatial autocorrelation coefficients cannot discriminate between the spatial structure induced by spatial dependence and that inherent to the variable itself." (Fortin and Dale 2005:140)

"The significance testing of the coefficients estimated at several distance classes is, however, problematic due to the lack of independence in the data. Indeed, the same data are used to estimate the coefficient values at different distance classes. This problem is inherent to all multiple testing analyses such as the quadrat variance methods presented in Chapter 2. Several procedures have been proposed to address this issue. The most widely used because of its simplicity and robustness (Oden 1984) is the Bonferroni correction that adjusts the probability level, at which to test the significance, by dividing $\alpha$ by the number of distance classes, k : $\alpha$ = $\alpha$ k ." (Fortin and Dale 2005:142)

"Given that most ecological data show some degree of positive autocorrelation, at short distances, the values of autocorrelation are generally positive. In fact, most of the time, the strongest value of spatial autocorrelation is within the first distance class." (Fortin and Dale 2005:143)

"When the values at short distances are positive and then, at a given distance, show fluctuation around the expected value, this can be interpreted as an indication of patchiness (Figure 3.8 c - f )." (Fortin and Dale 2005:143)

"To avoid having to compute spatial autocorrelation at fixed distances, by means of distance classes, Bj{\o}rnstad {\&} Falck (2001) proposed a continuous non-parametric estimator of spatial covariance resulting in a spline correlogram where the significance is based on a bootstrap confidence interval envelope (this is comparable to significance testing for Ripley's K as presented in Chapter 2)." (Fortin and Dale 2005:148)

Sill: the amount of spatially dependent structural variance in the data (BACARO: RICOTTA, 2007). There are cases where the experimental variogram does not have a sill. This implies that the range is undetermined. This can happen when the extent of study area is smaller than the spatial pattern, i.e. the spatial range, of the variable of interest (FORTIN: DALE, 2005). (note on p.150)

"Three key parameters are estimated from an experimental variogram to fit a theoretical variogram (Figure 3.10): the nugget effect, c 0 , the spatial range, a , and the sill, c 1 . The nugget is the intercept at the origin that is greater than zero. Theoretically, at h = 0, the semi-variance is also equal to 0. However, based on the shape of the experimental variogram, it can be unrealistic sometimes to force the theoretical variogram to go through 0. The nugget parameter is therefore used to account for the observed variability at short distances due to local random effects or measurement errors (e.g. accuracy of measurements, inappropriate sampling unit size, etc.). The spatial range indicates the distance up to which the spatial structure varies. In other words, the range indicates the maximal distance at which the variable is spatially autocorrelated. Beyond the range, the" (Fortin and Dale 2005:150)

Nugget effect: the level of spatial variation in the data at scales smaller than the distance separating adjacent pairs of plots (BACARO; RICOTTA, 2007). Nugget parameter is, then, used to account for the observed variability at short distances due to local random effects or measurement erros (FORTIN; DALE, 2005) (note on p.150)Range: indicates the maximal distance at which the variable is spatially autocoorelated. (note on p.150)rule of thumb: to interpret only the first two-thirds of a variogram! (note on p.151)

"distance among sampling locations does not affect the spatial structure of the data and the semi-variance values level off, forming the sill. There are cases where the experimental variogram does not have a sill. This also implies that the range is undetermined (Figure 3.11 a ). This can happen when the extent of the study area is smaller than the spatial pattern, i.e. the spatial range, of the variable of interest." (Fortin and Dale 2005:151)

"Interestingly, a random sampling design is able to detect significant spatial pattern because there is a wide range of spatial distances among the sampling locations (Fortin et al. 1989)." (Fortin and Dale 2005:160)

In fact, most of the time, it is difficult to disentangle them. The first spatial statistics were developed to e},

abstract = {Maps of species distributions or habitat suitability are required for many aspects of environmental research, resource management, and conservation planning. These include biodiversity assessment, reserve design, habitat management, and restoration, species and habitat conservation plans and predicting the effects of environmental change on species and ecosystems. The proliferation of methods and uncertainty regarding their effectiveness can be daunting to researchers, resource managers, and conservation planners alike. Franklin summarizes the methods used in species distribution modeling (also called niche modeling) and presents a framework for spatial prediction of species distributions based on the attributes (space, time, scale) of the data and questions being asked. The framework links theoretical ecological models of species distributions to spatial data on species and environment, and statistical models used for spatial predic-tion. Provides practical guidelines to students, researchers, and practitioners in a broad range of environmental sciences including ecology, geography, conserva-tion biology, and natural resources management. she joined the faculty of Arizona State University as a Pro-fessor in the Schools of Geographical Sciences and Life Sciences.

"As one could have expected, forward-selecting the explanatory variables independently in each subset (chemistry and physiography) does nothing to prevent inter-set correlations; some of the variables retained in each set are correlated with those of the other set. Therefore, fraction [b] remains important. Beware: conducting variable selection on the union of the two explanatory data sets would make" (Borcard et al 2011:196)

"fraction [b] very small or empty. If one wants to estimate how much of the variation of Y is explained jointly by the two explanatory data sets, it is important to carry out forward selection separately on the two sets of explanatory variables." (Borcard et al 2011:197)

"Living communities are spatially structured at many scales, and these structures are the result of several classes of processes." (Borcard et al 2011:241)

"On the other hand, beta diversity is the spatial variation in community composition; so, a study of the factors that can explain the spatial variation of community composition is in every respect an analysis of beta diversity." (Borcard et al 2011:241)

"The environmental control model advocates that external forces (climatic, physical, chemical) control living communities. If these factors are spatially structured, their patterns will reflect on the living communities (examples: patches of desert where the soil is humid enough to support vegetation; gradient of successive communities through an intertidal zone). The biotic control model predicts that intraand interspecific interactions within communities (examples: social groups of animals; top-down or bottom-up processes), as well as neutral processes such as ecological drift and limited dispersal, may result in spatial patterns which are the cause of spatial autocorrelation in the strict sense. Historical events (e.g. past disturbances like fire or human settlements) may have structured the environment in a way that still influences present-day communities." (Borcard et al 2011:241)

"The trend may be due to a process operating at a scale larger than the sampling area." (Borcard et al 2011:241)

A autocorrela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o espacial pode simular um gradiente verdadeiro se o processo b{\'{a}}sico que o gerou age em escala maior do que a {\'{a}}rea amostrada. (note on p.242)

 

"The spatial structure of these variables is reflected in y . When they form a gradient, they represent what Legendre (1993) called "true gradients", that is, gradient-like deterministic structures generated by external forces, whose error terms are not autocorrelated." (Borcard et al 2011:242)

"Spatial autocorrelation may mimic gradients if the underlying process has a range of influence larger than the sampling area." (Borcard et al 2011:242)

"In spatially correlated data, values at any given site can be predicted, at least partially, from the values at other sites, if the researcher knows the biological process and the locations of the sites." (Borcard et al 2011:243)

Corre{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o para os testes em cada lag.

Ou seja, se temos 10 lag, temos 10 testes, os quais precisam ser corrigidos.

A n{\~{a}}o corre{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do teste aumenta o risco de erro tipo 1, (note on p.247)

 

"We use the print() function to display the correlogram results because it allows for correction of the p values for multiple testing. In a correlogram, a test is performed for each lag (distance class), so that without correction, the overall risk of type I error is greatly increased. The Holm (1979) correction is applied here." (Borcard et al 2011:247)

"Spatial correlation in the multivariate domain can be assessed and tested for by means of a Mantel correlogram (Sokal 1986; Oden and Sokal 1986). Basically, one computes a normalized Mantel statistic r M (analogous to a Pearson's r coefficient) between a dissimilarity matrix among sites and a matrix where pairs of sites belonging to the same distance class receive value 0 and the other pairs, value 1." (Borcard et al 2011:247)

"To test the significance of coefficients of spatial correlation, however, the condition of second-order stationarity must be met. That condition states that the mean of the variable and its spatial covariance (numerator of (7.3)) are the same over the study area, and that its variance (denominator of (7.3)) is finite. This condition tells us, in other words, that the spatial variation of the data should be adequately described by the same single spatial correlation function in all portions of the study area. Spatial correlation coefficients cannot be tested for significance if an overall trend is present in the data ("true gradient"), or if the variable has been measured in a region where several distinct structures should be modelled by different spatial correlation" (Borcard et al 2011:249)

"functions. Data displaying simple trends can often be detrended by means of a firstor higher-degree function of the site geographical coordinates (Sect. 7.3). Another, relaxed form of stationarity is called the intrinsic assumption , a short form for "hypothesis of intrinsic stationarity of order 2" (Wackernagel 2003). This condition considers only the increments of the values of the variable; it states that the differences ( y h − y i ) for any distance d (in the numerator of (7.5)) have zero mean and constant and finite variance over the study area, independently of the location (Legendre and Legendre 1998). This condition allows one to compute and examine correlograms but without tests of significance." (Borcard et al 2011:250)

"Spatial structures can then either be related to explanatory variables representing hypothesized causes, or help generate new hypotheses as to which processes may have generated them." (Borcard et al 2011:251)

Justificativa metodol{\'{o}}gica/anal{\'{i}}tica para o uso de PCNMs. (note on p.257)

 

"The PCNM method presents several advantages over trend-surface analysis. It produces orthogonal (linearly independent) spatial variables over a much wider range of spatial scales. It allows the modelling of any type of spatial structures, as Borcard and Legendre (2002) have demonstrated through extensive simulations." (Borcard et al 2011:257)

"When the design is irregular, it may happen that a large truncation value must be chosen to allow all points to remain connected. A large truncation value means a loss of the finest spatial structures. Therefore, ideally, even an irregular sampling design should ensure that the minimum distance allowing all points to be connected is as short as possible." (Borcard et al 2011:257)

De repente, seria interessante usar os valores negativos, mas qual seria a interpreta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o pra isso? (note on p.258)

 

"The classical PCNM method produces eigenfunctions for all positive eigenval - ues. However, some of these eigenfunctions display negative spatial correlation. In most studies, one is primarily interested in patterns produced by spatially conta - gious processes, which display positive spatial correlation. Therefore, it is generally pre f erable to retain only the eigenfunctions with Moran's I {\textgreater} E ( I ), or to run separate analyses with the eigenfunctions with positive and negative spatial correlation. The relationship between the sign of the eigenvalues and the sign of the spatial correla - tion is not simple for PCNM, whereas the value of Moran's I is a linear function of the eigenvalue in the case of standard MEM eigenfunctions. So it is advised to compute Moran's I in all cases. Function PCNM() of the package PCNM presented in Sect. 7 .4.2. 3 can do that automatically (argument moran )." (Borcard et al 2011:258)

O "problema" da an{\'{a}}lise em fina escala. (note on p.269)

 

"Something has occurred here, which is often found in fine-scale PCNM analysis. The only convincing correlation is with the presence of bare peat, a feature that was very localized in the study area. Otherwise, in most cases, fine scale PCNM" (Borcard et al 2011:269)

"variables cannot be related to environmental descriptors and are mostly the signature of local spatial correlation generated by community dynamics. This topic will be addressed later." (Borcard et al 2011:270)

A parti{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da varia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o s{\'{o}} pode ser aplicada {\`{a}} vari{\'{a}}veis num{\'{e}}ricas. Para tanto, vari{\'{a}}veis categ{\'{o}}ricas (ou fatores) devem ser recodificadas a dados bin{\'{a}}rios (dummy variables). (note on p.271)

 

"Variation partitioning aims at quantifying the various unique and combined fractions of variation explained by several sources. In this context, a linear trend can be considered as a source of variation like any other." (Borcard et al 2011:271)

"The trend is likely to act on the response as well as the explanatory variables." (Borcard et al 2011:271)

"Therefore, in this application we advocate not to detrend the response data prior to variation partitioning, but rather to test for a linear trend and incorporate it explicitly in the partitioning procedure if it is significant" (Borcard et al 2011:271)

"In this example, we independently forward-select the X - Y coordinates, the environmental variables and the PCNM variables before variation partitioning. The significant PCNM variables are split into a broad and a fine-scale fraction. The par - titioning results are presented in Fig. 7 . 7 ." (Borcard et al 2011:271)

Valores negativos de R² devem ser interpretados como zero. Embora eles sejam levados em conta para a soma total das fra{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es testadas = 1. (note on p.274)

 

"Negative 2 adj R values correspond to explanatory variables that explain less of the response variables' variation than would be expected by chance; so, for all practical purposes, they can be interpreted as zeros and neglected during interpretation, although they must be taken into account for the sum of all fractions to be 1."

"When some variance is explained commonly by the environmental and spatial variables, one should be careful when inferring causal species-environment rela - tionships: the correlations may be due to a direct influence of the environmental variables on the species (direct induced spatial variation), or to some unmeasured underlying process that is spatially structured and is influencing both the mite com - munity and the environmental variables (e.g. spatial variation induced by a histori - cal causal factor)." (Borcard et al 2011:275)

"Fine scale structures are more likely explainable by spatial cor - relation produced by neutral biotic processes. Neutral processes include ecological drift (variation in species demography due to random reproduction and random survival of individuals due to competition, predator-prey interactions, etc.) and random dispersal (migration in animals, propagule dispersion in plants)." (Borcard et al 2011:275)

"An MSO plot of direct ordination can show whether the spatial structure in the response data can be explained by the explanatory (environmental) variables alone. In such a case, no detrending is necessary (H. Wagner, pers. comm.), but the confidence interval of the variogram is indicative only, since a variogram should be computed on stationary data."

"The decrease in compositional similarity with increasing geographic distance between sites (the distance-decay of similarity) is a common ecological pattern that can be explained by processes of dispersal limitation among communities in a metacommunity system (Bell 2001, see also Soininen et al. 2007). However, one could correctly argue that because environmental variation is often spatially structured, the distance-decay could also be attributed to differential responses of species abundance and niche processes to environmental gradients or patches (Bell et al. 2006)." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:201)

"It is assumed that the 'pure' spatial component (i.e. the spatial variation in species abundances after taking environmental variation into account) and the spatially structured environmental variation express the importance of neutral dynamics in shaping patterns of community structure (Gilbert and Lechowicz 2004)."

The exponential decrease in similarity expected underHubbell's (2001) neutral theory is analogous to SewallWright's (1943) isolation-by-distance process (IBD here-after), which is a neutral model for genetic differentiationamong populations in geographic space. Under this pro-cess, random processes of mutation and drift associatedwith geographically limited dispersal create an exponen-tial decrease of genetic similarity with increasing distances(Epperson 2003, Rousset 2004, Jenkins et al. 2010). (note on p.202)

 

"Estimates of the relative importance of partial components may fail to accurately represent environmental and spatial components of community variation (Gilbert and Bennett 2010). For example, Smith and Lundholm (2010) have recently shown that identical levels of dispersal and environmental control can produce very different variation components. In a more methodological context, one of the main problems with variation partitioning is that the lack of important spatiallystructured environmental predictors will overestimate the pure spatial component [c], which precludes its use as an unquestionable indicator of the relative role of neutral processes (Lalibert{\'{e}} et al. 2009)." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:202)

"Under this process, random processes of mutation and drift associated with geographically limited dispersal create an exponential decrease of genetic similarity with increasing distances (Epperson 2003, Rousset 2004, Jenkins et al. 2010)" (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:202)

"Three predictions for spatial patterns in species abundances under neutral dynamics (i.e. when environmentally-free spatial patterns in abundance is estimated by variation partitioning methods) can be derived: 1) species abundance maps will be independent (i.e. they will not show similar spatial patterns), 2) under limited and similar rates of dispersal - a major assumption of Hubbell's model - species abundances will be spatially structured and, in this case, correlograms will tend to be similar in shape, having similar magnitudes of spatial autocorrelation, and 3) the increasing degree of non-neutrality explaining species abundances, in which abundance patterns for different species are driven by similar ecological deterministic factors (e.g. an environmental gradient), will tend to generate patterns of correlation among abundances within groups of species with similar correlograms (i.e. within species with neutral and non-neutral dynamics)."

(Diniz-Filho et al 2012:202)

"we selected the set of parameters that generated the strongest spatial patterns in species abundance" (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:202)

"these strongest patterns arise when there is a high mortality rate within local communities (large disturbance D), and when dead individuals in a local community are replaced by many individuals (high M) from neighboring local communities (low G)" (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:202)

"if one is willing to follow our adapted protocol, we favor the use of a raw-data approach because it is necessary to have species' abundance values predicted by the pure spatial model (with R2 given by the component [c]) to distinguish neutral and niche processes. Additionally, contrary to some recent criticisms about the use of partial canonical analysis as a strategy to differentiate between niche and neutral processes (Gilbert and Bennett 2010, Smith and Lundholm 2010), our results show that the partial components from RDA effectively captured the relative magnitudes of niche and neutral processes driving variation in species abundances in a metacommunity context." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:207)

"Under neutral dynamics, the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation in species abundances at short distance classes tend to be similar and appears as a consequence of increasingly range cohesion for species that are randomly distributed in geographic space" (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:208)

"On the other hand, abundances will vary randomly when dispersal distance is large (Fig. 5). But this scenario would be easily detected by a variation partitioning approach, because random patterns in abundance will imply in a null component [c]." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:208)

"The empirical data set analyzed by us reinforces the validity of our approach. Specifically, results emerging from the analysis of the amphibians data set, for which the pure spatial component explained 18.5{\%} of the variation, were clearly consistent with our predictions for neutral dynamics."

"Finally, species can vary due to their life history and ecological characteristics, especially regarding dispersal abilities, as well as in the way they respond to different environmental factors. But even so it is important to note that if species are responding differently to environment, this violates a critical assumption of Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory, i.e. species equivalence." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:208)

"We showed here that the component [c] can be interpreted as resulting from the neutral process if correlograms have similar spatial structures due to common dispersal, and if demographic parameters and abundances are independent, leading to a null matrix correlation between R and M." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:209)

"However, if even small sets of species are responding to a few environmental effects that are spatially structured and missing from the analyses, this may appear to be neutral. Similarly, this apparent neutrality would also appear when all species are driven by environmental factors that explain a small part of the variance in abundances." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:209)

"The distance at which Moran's I becomes non-significant should be more similar for groups of species with similar dispersal abilities. Perhaps the protocol described above could be applied within these groups of species." (Diniz-Filho et al 2012:209)

"We recommend that researchers working on metacommunity dynamics should - if a significant pure spatial component is present in variation partitioning - investigate the abundances predicted by a pure spatial model using the protocol proposed here. Researchers should seek similar spatial autocorrelation patterns at short distances and independent estimates, leading to a null matrix correlation between M and R. This may allow researchers to confirm that spatial patterns in species abundances (after taking environmental variables into account) are due primarily to neutral dynamics, rather than to spatially-structured environmental factors missing from the analysis."

"While different subdisciplines offer unique perspectives that can contribute to solving problems, much of the subdisciplinary debate within ecology is in fact damaging to progress." (Pickett et al 2007:14)

"The second, related theme is the tools needed for effective integration." (Pickett et al 2007:14)

"Integration requires that we know what we understand, what we want to integrate, and how to achieve this." (Pickett et al 2007:14)

"While the subject matter is vast, the range of motivations ecologists have is just as diverse. Some ecologists want to solve pressing environmental problems, some want to know how the integrated physical and biological world works, and yet others want to know how organisms interact with each other. The end result of such a wide array of subjects and motivations is a stunningly diverse discipline." (Pickett et al 2007:15)

"Ecology has made substantial progress in both basic understanding and application since its origins over one hundred years ago." (Pickett et al 2007:15)

"At least three negative, but perhaps inevitable, consequences have arisen as a result of the rapid and admirable progress in ecology. First, with the development of subdisciplines, gaps in our understanding appear at the interfaces between those subdisciplines (Jones and Lawton 1995)." (Pickett et al 2007:18)

"For example, landscape ecology focuses on spatial heterogeneity in ecological systems, while ecosystem ecology focuses on fl uxes of matter and energy within ecosystems." (Pickett et al 2007:18)

"The gap that has arisen between these disciplines is the role of spatial heterogeneity in controlling ecosystem fl uxes." (Pickett et al 2007:18)

"Indeed, ecology itself can be seen as an invention fi lling the gap between organismal physiology and biogeography (e.g., Schimper 1903; also see McIntosh 1985)" (Pickett et al 2007:18)

"The second negative consequence of narrow progress is that disciplines tend to focus on specifi c scales or levels of organization (see Allen and Hoekstra 1992)." (Pickett et al 2007:18)

"Numerous problems that have been characterized by persistent dichotomous debate have ultimately been shown to benefi t from integration." (Pickett et al 2007:19)

"We might cite the same need for integration in debates over the roles of competition and predation in the structure and dynamics of communities (Roughgarden and Diamond 1986), the role of local versus regional processes in community organization (Griffi ths 1999, Srivastava 1999), the benefi ts of studying small or large ecological systems (Nixon 2001), the role of abiotic or biotic regulation of ecosystem fl uxes (Bond and Chase 2002), and the role of null models (Hubbell 2001)." (Pickett et al 2007:19)

"All of these examples show that debate is often problematic in ecology, and it often arises from poorly articulated concepts or contrasts. The limitations of dichotomous debate make it reasonable to suppose that advances in understanding may be made by asking questions such as when, where, and why some processes are more important than others, rather than asking whether process A or B is the right solution." (Pickett et al 2007:20)

"As representatives of the population paradigm, Begon et al. (1996) emphasized the individual organism, or populations and communities composed of individual organisms, as the basic units of study. The population ecology paradigm addresses patterns and causes of change in the distribution and abundance of organisms in space and time (Silvertown 1982). Abiotic factors are usually considered to be external forcing functions altering the dynamics of organisms and aggregations of organisms. In most cases, the ecosystem containing the population is taken as a given, for simplicity's sake. Thus, to answer the questions commonly posed by population ecologists, changes in material and energy fl ows have not usually been well connected to organismal dynamics (but see Cale 1988, Robertson 1991)." (Pickett et al 2007:22)

"Toward integration — organism centered. The scientifi c study of the processes infl uencing the distribution and abundance of organisms, the interactions among organisms, and the interactions between organisms and the transformation and fl ux of energy and matter (IES defi nition; see Likens 1992)."

"Although intuitively appealing, this classification has been interpreted differently among different authors. For instance, point diversity and alpha-diversity are often confused, given the difficulty of delimiting objectively habitats for plants. Further, many measures of diversity depend on sampling effort (they are "biased")." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:31)

"Beta-diversity is useful for studying ecological processes such as habitat specialization and dispersal limitation, but also large-scale patterns of abundance, rarity, and endemism." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:32)

"a correlation between diversity and geographical distance should be consistent with a prominent role of dispersal limitation. In the case of a fragmented habitat, it may be advisable to use an "effective distance" rather than the straight-line distance among sites, a distance that takes into account the habitat heterogeneity among plots." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:36)

"Adisadvantageof ordination is that it is difficult to provide a biological interpretation of these axes." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:36)

"Another disadvantage of ordination is that it is difficult to grasp the relative merit of the numerous existing ordination methods. As a result, most users are led to treat statistical techniques as cooking recipes rather than intuitively interpretable statistical methods, and consequently do not make full use of the data, or interpret these methods inappropriately (for an illustration, see the controversy between Legendre et al . 2005 and Tuomisto and Ruokolainen 2006)." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:36)

"The significance of correlations is then measured using Mantel tests for simple regressions, or partial Mantel tests for multiple regressions." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:36)

"The fundamental premise of this theory is therefore that the limited ability of species to colonize remote habitats should be a major explanatory factor for their heterogeneous distributional patterns." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:38)

Oligarquia entre as esp{\'{e}}cies em escala regional (Actinostemom sp em Mata das Flores)?!?! (note on p.40)

 

"Unlike previous works, Terborgh et al . (1996) addressed the relevance of the nonequilibrium hypothesis at the landscape scale, not just locally as had previously been done. They identified all trees greater than 10 cm diameter in several plots along the r{\'{i}}o Manu, southeast Peru, and showed that a few species were both abundant and widespread (i.e., "oligarchic species," sensu Pitman et al . 1999). Thus Hubbell's nonequilibrium theory, even if valid at the local scale, cannot be true at a larger scale. Hubbell (1997) then extended his local neutral model to a "twoscale" model where the local community interacts with a regional species pool in which diversity is maintained by evolutionary processes (see also Hubbell 2001, 2003, Ricklefs 2003, Chave 2004). Thus, by allowing for predictions at a larger scale, the neutral theory was significantly improved." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:40)

"For this reason, the conclusion in both papers that habitat specialization plays a far more important role than distance in structuring tropical tree communities remains unconvincing." (Carson and Schnitzer 2008:42)

abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographicallyweighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. Newstatistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution mapping of natural resources is much needed for monitoring and management of species, habitats and landscapes. Generally, detailed surveillance has been conducted as fieldwork, numerical analysis of satellite images or manual interpretation of aerial images, but methods of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning have recently produced promising examples of automated classifications of aerial imagery. The spatial application potential of such models is however still questionable since the transferability has rarely been evaluated. We investigated the potential of mosaic aerial orthophoto red, green and blue (RGB)/near infrared (NIR) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data for mapping very fine-scale vegetation structure in semi-natural terrestrial coastal areas in Denmark. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm, with a wide range of object-derived image and DEM variables, was applied for classification of vegetation structure types using two hierarchical levels of complexity. Models were constructed and validated by cross-validation using three scenarios: (1) training and validation data without spatial separation, (2) training and validation data spatially separated within sites, and (3) training and validation data spatially separated between different sites. Without spatial separation of training and validation data, high classification accuracies of coastal structures of 92.1{\%} and 91.8{\%} were achieved on coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. When models were applied to spatially separated observations within sites classification accuracies dropped to 85.8{\%} accuracy at the coarse thematic level, and 81.9{\%} at the fine thematic level. When the models were applied to observations from other sites than those trained upon the ability to discriminate vegetation structures was low, with 69.0{\%} and 54.2{\%} accuracy at the coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. Evaluating classification models with different degrees of spatial correlation between training and validation data was shown to give highly different prediction accuracies, thereby highlighting model transferability and application potential. Aerial image and DEM-based RF models had low transferability to new areas due to lack of representation of aerial image, landscape and vegetation variation in training data. They do, however, show promise at local scale for supporting conservation and management with vegetation mappings of high spatial and thematic detail based on low-cost image data.},

abstract = {Taxonomic distinctness indices are a family of anthropogenic stress indicators that have been used widely in marine ecosystems; however, their utility in freshwater ecosystems is still unclear. We used two taxonomic distinctness indices and species richness to assess relationships between nutrient gradients and three freshwater taxonomic groups, including diatoms, macrophytes and invertebrates. We found that the indices based on the three organismal groups showed generally rather clear relationships with the nutrient levels, indicating that these indices may bring useful additional information for the purposes of bioassessment. However, the two indices describing taxonomic distinctness showed opposite patterns in relation to nutrient levels. The indices for the three groups of organisms were generally poorly correlated with each other, showing that different organismal groups react differently to anthropogenic stress. Accordingly, taxonomic distinctness indices likely tell us about various aspects of nutrient enrichment of freshwater ecosystems. Our findings also emphasized that the value of these indices may be largely dependent on the organismal group used.},

abstract = {Maxent, one of the most commonly used methods for inferring species distributions and environmental tolerances from occurrence data, allows users to fit models of arbitrary complexity. Model complexity is typically constrained via a process known as L1 regularization, but at present little guidance is available for setting the appropriate level of regularization, and the effects of inappropriately complex or simple models are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the use of information criterion approaches to setting regularization in Maxent, and we compare models selected using information criteria to models selected using other criteria that are common in the literature. We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known ‘‘true'' initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods. We also demonstrate that information criteria may offer significant advantages over the methods commonly used in the literature.},

@article{Allouche2012a,
abstract = {For more than 50 y ecologists have believed that spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions promotes species richness by increasing opportunities for niche partitioning. However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity-diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area-heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings. The area-heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique perspective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation.},

Between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the middle temporal area contrast sensitivity functions become progressively steeper. Furthermore, many neurons in the middle temporal area are more sensitive than any cell encountered in early stages. Measurements made with stimuli of different sizes show that this high sensitivity depends on areal summation across the receptive field.},

@article{Condit1992,
abstract = {According to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis for the maintenance of species diversity, recruitment is inhibited in the immediate vicinity of adults by herbivores and pathogens. This reduces the per capita ability of abundant species to reproduce, relative to less common species, and gives rare or competitively inferior species a greater chance to persist. We tested this hypothesis in a 50-ha mapped plot of tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, by investigating the spatial patterns of sapling recruitment in 80 species of trees and shrubs. Two censuses of adults and saplings were carried out, in 1982 and in 1985. Recruits were defined as saplings of 1-8 cm dbh (diameter breast height) appearing in the 1985 census that were not present in 1982. The distance from each recruit to its nearest conspecific adult neighbor was measured. At various distances from adults, the number of conspecific recruits and the number of recruits of all species were tallied. The ratio of recruits of species i to all recruits was taken as an estimate of the probability that species i would occupy that site as an adult. A few species showed a significant reduction in recruitment probability close to adults, but more species showed a significant increase, and many other species showed no significant spatial pattern. Among canopy trees, about a third of the species showed some sign of local reduction in recruitment, but the distance over which the effect extended was usually less than 5 m; however, the most abundant canopy tree, Trichilia tuberculata, showed a sharp reduction in recruitment probability up to 10 m from adults. In treelets and shrubs, most species showed strong peaks in recruitment probability close to adults. Thus, most recruitment patterns did not fit the prediction of Janzen and Connell; however, two to three of the most common species may have reached densities at which a depression in local recruitment is regulating abundance.},

abstract = {When partitioning the variation of univariate or multivariate ecological data with respect to several submodels of spatial eigenfunctions (e.g., Moran's eigenvector maps, MEM) acting as explanatory data, a problem occurs: although the submodels are constructed to be orthogonal to one another, the partitioning based on adjusted R2 statistics produces nonzero values in the intersections between spatial submodels. This phenomenon is described and two solutions are proposed. The first solution is to apportion the intersection fractions proportionally to the variation explained by each submodel. The second solution consists in creating a hierarchy among the spatial submodels, in accordance with hierarchy theory. These solutions lead to new partitioning equations that are described in the Appendix. R functions are provided to carry out partitioning with respect to environmental variables and spatial eigenfunction submodels. This development is important for the correct interpretation of spatial modeling results implying explanatory environmental data as well as submodels of spatial eigenfunctions involving two or more spatial scales.},

abstract = {The study of patterns in living diversity is driven by the desire to find the universal rules that underlie the organization of ecosystems. The relative abundance distribution, which characterizes the total number and abundance of species in a community, is arguably the most fundamental measure in ecology. Considerable effort has been expended in striving for a general theory that can explain the form of the distribution. Despite this, a mechanistic understanding of the form in terms of physiological and environmental parameters remains elusive. Recently, it has been proposed that space plays a central role in generating the patterns of diversity. Here we show that an understanding of the observed form of the relative abundance distribution requires a consideration of how individuals pack in time. We present a framework for studying the dynamics of communities which generalizes the prevailing species-based approach to one based on individuals that are characterized by their physiological traits. The observed form of the abundance distribution and its dependence on richness and disturbance are reproduced, and can be understood in terms of the trade-off between time to reproduction and fecundity.},

abstract = {Understanding how plant life history affects species vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances and environmental change is a major ecological challenge. We examined how vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size relate to extinction risk throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. We used a database containing species-level information of 6,929 angiosperms within 112 families and a molecular-based working phylogeny. We used decision trees, standard regression, and phylogenetic regression to explore the relationships between species attributes and extinction risk. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in extinction risk. Vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size were related to species extinction risk, but the effect of growth form was not evident after phylogeny was controlled for. Species restricted to either rocky outcrops or scrub vegetation on sandy coastal plains exhibited the highest extinction risk among vegetation types, a finding that supports the hypothesis that species adapted to resource-limited environments are more vulnerable to extinction. Among growth forms, epiphytes were associated with the highest extinction risk in non-phylogenetic regression models, followed by trees, whereas shrubs and climbers were associated with lower extinction risk. However, the higher extinction risk of epiphytes was not significant after correcting for phylogenetic relatedness. Our findings provide new indicators of extinction risk and insights into the mechanisms governing plant vulnerability to extinction in a highly diverse flora where human disturbances are both frequent and widespread.

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

@article{Leigh2007,
abstract = {To resolve a panselectionist paradox, the population geneticist Kimura invented a neutral theory, where each gene is equally likely to enter the next generation whatever its allelic type. To learn what could be explained without invoking Darwinian adaptive divergence, Hubbell devised a similar neutral theory for forest ecology, assuming each tree is equally likely to reproduce whatever its species. In both theories, some predictions worked; neither theory proved universally true. Simple assumptions allow neutral theorists to treat many subjects still immune to more realistic theory. Ecologists exploit far fewer of these possibilities than population geneticists, focussing instead on species abundance distributions, where their predictions work best, but most closely match non-neutral predictions. Neutral theory cannot explain adaptive divergence or ecosystem function, which ecologists must understand. By addressing new topics and predicting changes in time, however, ecological neutral theory can provide probing null hypotheses and stimulate more realistic theory.},

abstract = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high. The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.},

abstract = {Site-to-site variation in species composition ($\beta$-diversity) generally increases from low- to high-diversity regions. Although biogeographical differences in community assembly mechanisms may explain this pattern, random sampling effects can create this pattern through differences in regional species pools. Here, we compared assembly mechanisms between spatially extensive networks of temperate and tropical forest plots with highly divergent species pools (46 vs. 607 species). After controlling for sampling effects, $\beta$-diversity of woody plants was similar and higher than expected by chance in both forests, reflecting strong intraspecific aggregation. However, different mechanisms appeared to explain aggregation in the two forests. In the temperate forest, aggregation reflected stronger environmental correlations, suggesting an important role for species-sorting (e.g. environmental filtering) processes, whereas in the tropics, aggregation reflected stronger spatial correlations, more likely reflecting dispersal limitation. We suggest that biogeographical differences in the relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms contribute to these striking gradients in global biodiversity.},

abstract = {Data from a global network of large, permanent plots in lowland tropical forests demonstrate (1) that the phenomenon of tropical tree rarity is real and (2) that almost all the species diversity in such forests is due to rare species. Theoretical and empirically based reasoning suggests that many of these rare species are not as geographically widespread as previously thought. These findings suggest that successful strategies for conserving global tree diversity in lowland tropical forests must pay much more attention to the biogeography of rarity, as well as to the impact of climate change on the distribution and abundance of rare species. Because the biogeography of many tropical tree species is poorly known, a high priority should be given to documenting the distribution and abundance of rare tropical tree species, particularly in Amazonia, the largest remaining tropical forested region in the world.},

These advances in geostatistics, rate of change analysis and boundary detection and their application to floristic and environmental data at the community scale are reviewed. Issues of scale, spatial autocorrelation and terminology are introduced. Approaches to the description of spatial pattern in plant assemblages and environmental data, the quantification and removal of spatial autocorrelation, the spatial interpolation of data, techniques for the description and analysis of spatial rate of change and finally boundary detection are all reviewed in turn. Despite the development of new methods, the extent to which they have been applied more widely within both plant ecology and biogeography is limited. The paper concludes that perhaps the time is right for biogeographers to reassess the potential significance of these areas for the subject.},

abstract = {We present a unique perspective on the role of historical processes in community assembly by synthesizing analyses of species turnover among communities with environmental data and independent, population genetic-derived estimates of among-community dispersal. We sampled floodplain and terra firme communities of the diverse tree genus Inga (Fabaceae) across a 250-km transect in Amazonian Peru and found patterns of distance-decay in compositional similarity in both habitat types. However, conventional analyses of distance-decay masked a zone of increased species turnover present in the middle of the transect. We estimated past seed dispersal among the same communities by examining geographic plastid DNA variation for eight widespread Inga species and uncovered a population genetic break in the majority of species that is geographically coincident with the zone of increased species turnover. Analyses of these and 12 additional Inga species shared between two communities located on opposite sides of the zone showed that the populations experienced divergence 42,000-612,000 y ago. Our results suggest that the observed distance decay is the result not of environmental gradients or dispersal limitation coupled with ecological drift--as conventionally interpreted under neutral ecological theory--but rather of secondary contact between historically separated communities. Thus, even at this small spatial scale, historical processes seem to significantly impact species' distributions and community assembly. Other documented zones of increased species turnover found in the western Amazon basin or elsewhere may be related to similar historical processes.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes of spatial variation in species richness is a major research focus of biogeography and macroecology. Gridded environmental data and species richness maps have been used in increasingly sophisticated curve-fitting analyses, but these methods have not brought us much closer to a mechanistic understanding of the patterns. During the past two decades, macroecologists have successfully addressed technical problems posed by spatial autocorrelation, intercorrelation of predictor variables and non-linearity. However, curve-fitting approaches are problematic because most theoretical models in macroecology do not make quantitative predictions, and they do not incorporate interactions among multiple forces. As an alternative, we propose a mechanistic modelling approach. We describe computer simulation models of the stochastic origin, spread, and extinction of species' geographical ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous, gridded domain and describe progress to date regarding their implementation. The output from such a general simulation model (GSM) would, at a minimum, consist of the simulated distribution of species ranges on a map, yielding the predicted number of species in each grid cell of the domain. In contrast to curve-fitting analysis, simulation modelling explicitly incorporates the processes believed to be affecting the geographical ranges of species and generates a number of quantitative predictions that can be compared to empirical patterns. We describe three of the 'control knobs' for a GSM that specify simple rules for dispersal, evolutionary origins and environmental gradients. Binary combinations of different knob settings correspond to eight distinct simulation models, five of which are already represented in the literature of macroecology. The output from such a GSM will include the predicted species richness per grid cell, the range size frequency distribution, the simulated phylogeny and simulated geographical ranges of the component species, all of which can be compared to empirical patterns. Challenges to the development of the GSM include the measurement of goodness of fit (GOF) between observed data and model predictions, as well as the estimation, optimization and interpretation of the model parameters. The simulation approach offers new insights into the origin and maintenance of species richness patterns, and may provide a common framework for investigating the effects of contemporary climate, evolutionary history and geometric constraints on global biodiversity gradients. With further development, the GSM has the potential to provide a conceptual bridge between macroecology and historical biogeography.},

abstract = {Patterns of phylogenetic relatedness within communities have been widely used to infer the importance of different ecological and evolutionary processes during community assembly, but little is known about the relative ability of community phylogenetics methods and null models to detect the signature of processes such as dispersal, competition and filtering under different models of trait evolution. Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.},

abstract = {Mechanistic models of community assembly state that biotic and abiotic filters constrain species establishment through selection on their functional traits. Predicting this assembly process is hampered because few studies directly incorporate environmental measurements and scale up from species to community level and because the functional traits' significance is environment dependent. We analyzed community assembly by measuring structure, environmental conditions, and species traits of secondary forests in a species-rich tropical system. We found, as hypothesized, that community structure shaped the local environment and that strong relationships existed between this environment and the traits of the most successful species of the regeneration communities. Path and multivariate analyses showed that temperature and leaf traits that regulate it were the most important factors of community differentiation. Comparisons between the trait composition of the forest's regeneration, juvenile, and adult communities showed a consistent community assembly pattern. These results allowed us to identify the major functional traits and environmental factors involved in the assembly of dry-forest communities and demonstrate that environmental filtering is a predictable and fundamental process of community assembly, even in a complex system such as a tropical forest.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of functional traits for the study of plant ecology, we do not know how variation in a given trait changes across ecological scales, which prevents us from assessing potential scale-dependent aspects of trait variation. To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

abstract = {The high alpha-diversity of tropical forests has been amply documented, but beta-diversity-how species composition changes with distance-has seldom been studied. We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Community assembly involves two antagonistic processes that select functional traits in opposite directions. Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

We illustrate our approach with a case study of occupancy dynamics of Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nesting territories. Examination of the hypothesis of system equilibrium suggests that the system satisfies equilibrium conditions. Estimates of vital rates obtained using patch occupancy models are used to estimate equilibrium patch occupancy of eagles. We then compute estimates of sensitivity metrics and discuss their implications for eagle population ecology and management. Finally, we discuss the intuition underlying our sensitivity metrics and then provide examples of ecological questions that can be addressed using perturbation analyses. For instance, the sensitivity metrics lead to predictions about the relative importance of local colonization and local extinction probabilities in influencing equilibrium occupancy for rare and common species.},

@article{Olszewski2012,
abstract = {Explaining the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is critical for understanding the potential consequences of present-day environmental change on ecological communities, as well as the evolutionary history of ecosystems in the Earth's past. Much effort in theoretical ecology has focused on identifying mechanisms that promote stable coexistence of species at equilibrium. However, in a consumer-resource model of competition along an environmental gradient, high-diversity assemblages have the potential to persist in non-equilibrium states for millions of generations with very little species loss. Species' populations in such competitively accommodated communities show slow drift; if disrupted, they rapidly reorganize into alternative persistent states. Fossil examples of prolonged ecological stability lasting 1-5 Myr punctuated by rapid reorganization (e.g. brachiopods from the Permian Reef of west Texas) suggest that some palaeocommunities represent a record of periodically disrupted transient states rather than stable equilibria. The similarity between the theoretical results reported here and palaeontological data suggests that the maintenance of high-diversity communities, both in the past and present, may reflect long-duration, non-equilibrium transient dynamics. If so, this has implications for the response of such communities to present-day environmental change, as well as for the evolution of lineages in such systems.},

abstract = {Individuals often differ in what they do. This has been recognised since antiquity. Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary significance of such variation is attracting widespread interest, which is burgeoning to an extent that is fragmenting the literature. As a first attempt at synthesis, we focus on individual differences in behaviour within populations that exceed the day-to-day variation in individual behaviour (i.e. behavioural specialisation). Indeed, the factors promoting ecologically relevant behavioural specialisation within natural populations are likely to have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. We discuss such individual differences from three distinct perspectives: individual niche specialisations, the division of labour within insect societies and animal personality variation. In the process, while recognising that each area has its own unique motivations, we identify a number of opportunities for productive 'cross-fertilisation' among the (largely independent) bodies of work. We conclude that a complete understanding of evolutionarily and ecologically relevant individual differences must specify how ecological interactions impact the basic biological process (e.g. Darwinian selection, development and information processing) that underpin the organismal features determining behavioural specialisations. Moreover, there is likely to be co-variation amongst behavioural specialisations. Thus, we sketch the key elements of a general framework for studying the evolutionary ecology of individual differences.},

This is used to reveal patterns of phylogenetic community variation and to measure and test by specified null models the phylogenetic signal at the metacommunity level, which we distinguish from phylogenetic signal at the species pool level. The former indicates that communities more similar in their phylogenetic structure are also similar in their average trait values, which may indicate species' niche conservation for the given traits.

We found that positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning decreased with increasing stress intensity in absolute terms. However, in relative terms, increasing stress had a stronger negative effect on low-diversity communities. This shows that more diverse biotic communities are functionally less susceptible to environmental stress, emphasises the need to maintain high levels of biodiversity as an insurance against impacts of changing environmental conditions and sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects in stressed ecosystems.},

Consistent with theory, a negative correlation between seed size and seed number led to a higher number of species in the communities and a corresponding wider range of seed size (a measure of functional richness) by promoting coexistence of large- and small-seeded species. Our study provides the first direct evidence that a seed size/number trade-off may contribute to species coexistence, and at a wider context, demonstrates the potential role of functional trade-offs in maintaining species diversity.},

abstract = {Net primary productivity is a principal driver of biodiversity; large-scale regions with higher productivity generally have more species. This pattern emerges because beta-diversity (compositional variation across local sites) increases with productivity, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Using data from a long-term experiment in replicate ponds, I show that higher beta-diversity at higher productivity resulted from a stronger role for stochastic relative to deterministic assembly processes with increasing productivity. This shift in the relative importance of stochasticity was most consistent with the hypothesis of more intense priority effects leading to multiple stable equilibria at higher productivity. Thus, shifts in community assembly mechanisms across a productivity gradient may underlie one of the most prominent biodiversity gradients on the planet.},

abstract = {We evaluated floristic and ecological changes in plant communities after disturbance in Southern Atlantic Rain Forests, in the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, S??o Paulo, Paran?? and Santa Catarina. We compiled data for 410 tree species from 18 forests ranging from 4 to 120 years after disturbance, and classified them by dispersal mode (animal vs. non-animal), successional group (pioneer vs. non-pioneer), vertical position (understorey vs. non-understorey) and geographic distribution (Atlantic Forest vs. widespread). We found that both geographical location and time since disturbance affect species distribution and ??-diversity. Regression analyses showed significant, positive and strong relations (0.26 ??? r2 ??? 0.63; P {\textless} 0.05) between fragment age and species richness, proportion of animal dispersed species, of non-pioneer species, of understorey species and with restricted distribution. Applying our data to values found in literature we predict that a forest needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of animal-dispersed species (80{\%} of the species), the proportion of non-pioneer species (90{\%}) and of understorey species (50{\%}) found in mature forests. On the other hand much more time is necessary (between one and four thousand years) to reach the endemism levels (40{\%} of the species) that exist in mature forests. Our findings indicate that disturbance results in significant changes in species composition (decrease in endemic species) and ecological guilds (decrease in zoochory and in non-pioneer and understorey species), but forests can gradually recover over time spans of hundreds of years. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we review these opinions and strip away some unfortunate problems with semantics to reveal three major underlying questions. Only one of these relates to neutral theory and the importance of ecological drift, whereas the others involve the link between pattern and process, the tradeoff between simplicity and complexity in modeling, and the role of stochasticity and drift in ecology. We explain how neutral theory cannot be simultaneously used both as a null hypothesis and as an approximation. However, we also show how neutral theory always has a valuable use in one of these two roles, even though the real world is not neutral.},

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.},

We tested whether secondary forests follow equilibrium or non-equilibrium dynamics by evaluating community reassembly over time, across different successional stages, and among multiple life stages. Based on long-term and static data from six 1-ha plots in NE Costa Rica, we show that secondary forests are undergoing reassembly of canopy tree and palm species composition through the successful recruitment of seedlings, saplings, and young trees of mature forest species. Such patterns were observed over time within sites and across successional stages. Floristic reassembly in secondary forests showed a clear convergence with mature forest community composition, supporting an equilibrium model. This resilience stems from three key factors co-occurring locally: high abundance of generalist species in the regional flora, high levels of seed dispersal, and local presence of old-growth forest remnants.},

Using this framework and continental data on stream environment, diatoms, invertebrates and fish, I address the following fundamental, but unresolved ecological questions: how do species partition their resources across environments, is energetic equivalence among them possible, are generalists more common than specialists, why are locally abundant species also regionally prevalent, and, do microbes have different biogeography than macroorganisms? The discovery that community scaling behaviour is environmentally constrained calls for better integration of macroecology and environmental science.},

abstract = {Deterministic theories in community ecology suggest that local, niche-based processes, such as environmental filtering, biotic interactions and interspecific trade-offs largely determine patterns of species diversity and composition. In contrast, more stochastic theories emphasize the importance of chance colonization, random extinction and ecological drift. The schisms between deterministic and stochastic perspectives, which date back to the earliest days of ecology, continue to fuel contemporary debates (e.g. niches versus neutrality). As illustrated by the pioneering studies of Robert H. MacArthur and co-workers, resolution to these debates requires consideration of how the importance of local processes changes across scales. Here, we develop a framework for disentangling the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in generating site-to-site variation in species composition ($\beta$-diversity) along ecological gradients (disturbance, productivity and biotic interactions) and among biogeographic regions that differ in the size of the regional species pool. We illustrate how to discern the importance of deterministic processes using null-model approaches that explicitly account for local and regional factors that inherently create stochastic turnover. By embracing processes across scales, we can build a more synthetic framework for understanding how niches structure patterns of biodiversity in the face of stochastic processes that emerge from local and biogeographic factors.},

We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have facilitated the generation of very high resolution (VHR) environmental data. Exploratory studies suggested that, if used in species distribution models (SDMs), these data should enable modelling species' micro-habitats and allow improving predictions for fine-scale biodiversity management. In the present study, we tested the influence, in SDMs, of predictors derived from a VHR digital elevation model (DEM) by comparing the predictive power of models for 239 plant species and their assemblages fitted at six different resolutions in the Swiss Alps. We also tested whether changes of the model quality for a species is related to its functional and ecological characteristics. Refining the resolution only contributed to slight improvement of the models for more than half of the examined species, with the best results obtained at 5 m, but no significant improvement was observed, on average, across all species. Contrary to our expectations, we could not consistently correlate the changes in model performance with species characteristics such as vegetation height. Temperature, the most important variable in the SDMs across the different resolutions, did not contribute any substantial improvement. Our results suggest that improving resolution of topographic data only is not sufficient to improve SDM predictions - and therefore local management - compared to previously used resolutions (here 25 and 100 m). More effort should be dedicated now to conduct finer-scale in-situ environmental measurements (e.g. for temperature, moisture, snow) to obtain improved environmental measurements for fine-scale species mapping and management.},

abstract = {Ecological approaches to community assembly have emphasized the interplay between neutral processes, niche-based environmental filtering and niche-based species sorting in an interactive milieu. Recently, progress has been made in terms of aligning our vocabulary with conceptual advances, assessing how trait-based community functional parameters differ from neutral expectation and assessing how traits vary along environmental gradients. Experiments have confirmed the influence of these processes on assembly and have addressed the role of dispersal in shaping local assemblages. Community phylogenetics has forged common ground between ecologists and biogeographers, but it is not a proxy for trait-based approaches. Community assembly theory is in need of a comparative synthesis that addresses how the relative importance of niche and neutral processes varies among taxa, along environmental gradients, and across scales. Towards that goal, we suggest a set of traits that probably confer increasing community neutrality and regionality and review the influences of stress, disturbance and scale on the importance of niche assembly. We advocate increasing the complexity of experiments in order to assess the relative importance of multiple processes. As an example, we provide evidence that dispersal, niche processes and trait interdependencies have about equal influence on trait-based assembly in an experimental grassland.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of phylogenetic data, computing power and informatics tools has facilitated a rapid expansion of studies that apply phylogenetic data and methods to community ecology. Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

Laws and models in community ecology are highly contingent, and their domain is usually very local. This fact does not mean that community ecology is a weak science; in fact, it is the locus of exciting advances, with growing mechanistic understanding of causes, patterns, and processes. Further, traditional community ecological research, often local, experimental, and reductionist, is crucial in understanding and responding to many environmental problems, including those posed by global changes. For both scientific and societal reasons, it is not time to abandon community ecology.},

abstract = {Leaf litter represents an important link between tree community composition, forest productivity and biomass, and ecosystem processes. In forests, the spatial distribution of trees and species-specific differences in leaf litter production and quality are likely to cause spatial heterogeneity in nutrient returns to the forest floor and, therefore, in the re-distribution of soil nutrients. Using mapped trees and leaf litter data for 12 tree species in a subtropical forest with a well-documented history of land use we: (1) parameterize spatially-explicit models of leaf litter biomass and nutrient deposition; (2) assess variation in leaf litter inputs across forest areas with different land use legacies; and (3) determine the degree to which the quantity and quality of leaf litter inputs and soil physical characteristics are associated with spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient ratios (C:N and N:P). The models captured the effects of tree size and location on spatial variation in leaf litter fall (R2 = 0.31...},

abstract = {Disturbance and dispersal are two fundamental ecological processes that shape diversity patterns, yet their interaction and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood, and evidence from natural systems is particularly lacking. Using an invertebrate rock pool metacommunity in South Africa as a natural model system, we studied potential interactive effects of disturbance regime and patch isolation on diversity patterns of species with contrasting dispersal modes (passive vs. active dispersal). Isolation and disturbance regime had negative synergistic effects on alpha diversity: both directly, by excluding late-successional species from isolated patches; and indirectly, by modulating establishment success of generalist predators in well-connected patches. Unimodal relationships between isolation and alpha diversity, as predicted by mass effects, were only detected for passive dispersers in frequently disturbed patches and not in active dispersers. For passive dispersers, indications for a positive effect of isolation and a negative effect of disturbance on beta diversity were found, presumably due to differences in deterministic succession and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics among different patch types. Our findings illustrate that interactions between dispersal rates and disturbance regime are important when explaining species diversity patterns in metacommunities and support the idea that diversity in frequently disturbed habitats is more sensitive to effects of dispersal-based processes.},

abstract = {The importance of niche vs. neutral assembly mechanisms in structuring tropical tree communities remains an important unsettled question in community ecology [Bell G (2005) Ecology 86:1757-1770]. There is ample evidence that species distributions are determined by soils and habitat factors at landscape ({\textless}10(4) km(2)) and regional scales. At local scales ({\textless}1 km(2)), however, habitat factors and species distributions show comparable spatial aggregation, making it difficult to disentangle the importance of niche and dispersal processes. In this article, we test soil resource-based niche assembly at a local scale, using species and soil nutrient distributions obtained at high spatial resolution in three diverse neotropical forest plots in Colombia (La Planada), Ecuador (Yasuni), and Panama (Barro Colorado Island). Using spatial distribution maps of {\textgreater}0.5 million individual trees of 1,400 species and 10 essential plant nutrients, we used Monte Carlo simulations of species distributions to test plant-soil associations against null expectations based on dispersal assembly. We found that the spatial distributions of 36-51{\%} of tree species at these sites show strong associations to soil nutrient distributions. Neutral dispersal assembly cannot account for these plant-soil associations or the observed niche breadths of these species. These results indicate that belowground resource availability plays an important role in the assembly of tropical tree communities at local scales and provide the basis for future investigations on the mechanisms of resource competition among tropical tree species.},

In this study, we use three separate data sets on herbivorous insects on oak (Quercus robur) to estimate the relative effects of host plant genotype (G), location (E), and the G x E interaction on herbivore community structure: a common garden experiment replicated at the landscape scale (approximately 5 km2); two common gardens separated at the regional scale (approximately 10 000 km2); and survey data on wild trees in various spatial settings. Our experiments and survey reveal that, at the landscape scale, the insect community is strongly affected by the spatial setting, with 32{\%} of the variation in species richness explained by spatial connectivity. In contrast, G and G x E play minor roles in structuring the insect community. Results remained similar when extending the spatial scale of the study from the more local (landscape) level to the regional level. We conclude that in our study system, spatial processes play a major role in structuring these insect communities at both the landscape and regional scales, whereas host plant genotype seems of secondary importance.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local rich- ness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.},

@article{Sollins1998,
abstract = {The soil properties most likely to influence species composition in lowland tropical rain forests are, in decreasing order of importance: P availability, Al toxicity, drainage, water-holding capacity, and availability of K, Ca, and Mg. A total of 18 studies were located in which species occurrence was studied in relation to such soil properties. Several of these report clear trends with soil physical properties, mainly drainage as affected by topographic position. Only three offer evidence for correlations with soil chemical properties. In all three, the study area spanned soils of very widely differing age and thus soil fertility. Failure to find correlations with chemical properties may be due to: lack of range in soil fertility across the sites studied, failure of soil test methods to measure availability of nutrients to plants, or temporal and spatial variability in soil properties. Existing soil classification systems do not provide enough information on any particular soil to help establish relations between its chemical properties and plant distribution. None- theless, soils at ecological study sites must be classified if their nature and properties are to be made clear to others working worldwide. Traditional, largely subjective, soil-mapping techniques may reduce sampling needs by allowing stratification of soil and plant sampling by broad soil types. The mapping must be done, however, at a scale similar to the patchiness of the plant community (usually finer than 1:5000), something done in only 3 of the 18 studies located. Correlative studies are only the first step in understanding causal relations between soil properties and plant species distribution. Next, nutritional, drainage, and water requirements must be established for individual species. Then field experiments must be set up to establish cause and effect. Key},

abstract = {During the Neogene, the Brazilian cerrado became established as a large-scale vegetation type. Cerrado lineages started to diversify less than 10 million years ago, coinciding with the rise to dominance of fl ammable C 4 grasses and the expansion of the savanna biome. Cerrado lineages are strongly associated with adaptations to fi re and have sister groups in fi re-free nearby forests, implying that the cerrado formed in situ via adaptive shifts to resist fi re. By including phylogeny into the analysis of biological traits, we investigated trait diversity of cerrado woody species in a phylogenetic context, sampling a cerrado site in central Brazil. Decomposing trait diversity along the nodes of a phylogenetic tree of cerrado woody species, we found that the rate of trait diversifi cation was higher in the past, coinciding with the major species diversifi cation of angiosperms in mid-Cretaceous, long before the cerrado originated. Some more recent adaptive shifts to resist fi re, however, must have occurred during the origin and expansion of the cerrado woody fl ora. Analysing values of each trait separately at the tips of the phylogenetic tree, we found that most trait values were randomly distributed, probably because we analysed only species that had already been fi ltered by drought, fi re, and soil. Analysing values of all traits simultaneously at the tips, we found close to root events and broad, macro-evolutionary patterns, called ‘ global structures ' , opposing some lineages, especially Fabaceae and Myrtaceae, with diff erent ecological strategies. Fabaceae presented compound, large, tender leaves, with high nitrogen content due to symbiosis with nitrogen-fi xing bacteria, and Myrtaceae presented simple, small, tough leaves, with low nitrogen and high potassium content. We also found relatively recent events that induced divergence of the evolutionary strategies close to the tips, called ‘ local structures ' , involving more recent changes in most lineages.},

abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 = 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 = 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 {\textless} or = 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (H(max)) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and H(max) are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait-demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 {\textless} 0.1 for three and r2 {\textless} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43-44{\%} of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth-mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for {\textgreater} 80{\%} of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and H(max) made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and H(max) occurred at all positions on the growth-mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

@article{Oliveira-Filho2000,
abstract = {The tree flora of southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forests was investigated according to two main aspects: (a) the variations in floristic composition of both rain and semi-deciduous forests were analyzed in terms of geographic and climatic variables by performing multivariate analyses on 125 existing floristic checklists; and (b) the links of both rain and semi- deciduous forests to Amazonian forests and Cerrados (woody savanna) were assessed. All analyses were performed at the species, genus, and family levels. The information obtained for the 125 forest areas was organized into an environmental database containing geographic and climatic records, and a floristic database containing binary presence records for 2532 species, 520 genera, and 106 families. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) were utilized to assess the relationship between geographic and climatic variables, and tree flora composition. Venn diagrams and cluster analyses were used to assess the floristic links to Amazonian forests and Cerrados. The following patterns were detected at all three taxonomic levels: (a) the differentiation between rain and semi-deciduous forests is floristically consistent and strongly correlated with rainfall regime, although transitions may be abrupt to gradual; (b) a north–south differentiation exists for both rain and semi-deciduous forests, probably caused by variations in both temperature and rainfall regime; (c) The flora of semi- deciduous forests also changes with increasing distance from the ocean and the associated increasing rainfall seasonality; and (d) elevation and associated temperatures are strongly correlated with the internal differentiation of both rain and semi-deciduous forests. To a considerable extent, the tree flora of semi-deciduous forests is a subset of the rain forest flora, probably extracting species that are able to cope with a longer dry season. There is greater floristic similarity at the species level between Atlantic rain and semi-deciduous forests than between any of these and either Amazonian rain forests or Cerrados. Nevertheless, semi-deciduous forests and Cerrados show stronger links, particularly at the generic and familial levels. Therefore, there is little floristic ground for viewing Atlantic rain forests as being closer to their Amazonian counterparts than to the adjacent semi-deciduous forests. The most appropriate view of rain and semi- deciduous forests in southeastern Brazil is that of a continuum in tree species distribution.We suggest that the definition of Atlantic forests should be as comprehensive as that of Amazonian forests.

@article{JANZEN2015,
abstract = {The relative importance of niche-based (e.g., competitive or stress-based) and stochastic (e.g., random dispersal) processes in structuring ecological communities is frequently analyzed by studying trait distributions of co-occurring species. While filtering processes, such as the exclusion of stress-intolerant species from particular habitats, increase the trait similarity between co-occurring species, other processes, such as resource competition, can limit the similarity of co-occurring species. Comparing the observed trait distribution patterns in communities to null expectations from randomized communities (e.g., a draw of the same observed richness from the regional pool) therefore gives a first indication of the dominant process driving community assembly. However, such comparisons do not inform us about the relative contribution of these different processes in shaping community compositions in case of their joint operation (a likely scenario). Using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach, we develop a new method that allows inference of the relative importance of dispersal, filtering, and limiting similarity processes for the assembly of observed communities with known species and trait composition. We applied this approach to a tree community data set, collected across 20 plots along strong rainfall and fire gradients in a South African savanna. Based on comparisons with simulations, we find that our new approach is powerful in identifying which community assembly scenario has the highest probability to generate the observed trait distribution patterns, while traditional null model comparisons perform poorly in detecting signs of limiting similarity. For the studied savanna tree communities, our analysis yields that dispersal processes are most important in shaping the functional trait distribution patterns. Furthermore, our models indicate that filtering processes were relatively most important in areas with high fire frequencies, while limiting similarity processes were relatively most important in areas with low fire frequency and high rainfall. We conclude that our new method is a promising improvement on current approaches to estimate the relative importance of community assembly processes across different species groups, ecosystems, and biomes. Future model modifications (e.g., the inclusion of individual-based processes) could provide further steps in uncovering the underlying assembly processes behind observed community patterns. Key},

abstract = {Fully mapped tree census plots of large area, 25 to 52 hectares, have now been completed at six different sites in tropical forests, including dry deciduous to wet evergreen forest on two continents. One of the main goals of these plots has been to evaluate spatial patterns in tropical tree populations. Here the degree of aggregation in the distribution of 1768 tree species is examined based on the average density of conspecific trees in circular neighborhoods around each tree. When all individuals larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were included, nearly every species was more aggregated than a random distribution. Considering only larger trees ({\textgreater}/= 10 centimeters in diameter), the pattern persisted, with most species being more aggregated than random. Rare species were more aggregated than common species. All six forests were very similar in all the particulars of these results.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {This book describes ggplot2, a new data visualization package for R that uses the insights from Leland Wilkison's Grammar of Graphics to create a powerful and flexible system for creating data graphics. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome, publication-quality plots, with automatic legends created from the plot specification superpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots to name a few) from different data sources, with automatically adjusted common scales add customisable smoothers that use the powerful modelling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalised additive models and robust regression save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements, and that can easily be applied to multiple plots approach your graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying their data in an informative and attractive way. You will need some basic knowledge of R (i.e. you should be able to get your data into R), but ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. Hadley Wickham is an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and is interested in developing computational and cognitive tools for making data preparation, visualization, and analysis easier. He has developed 15 R packages and in 2006 he won the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work on the ggplot and reshape R packages.},

@article{Chave1999,
abstract = {Competition for light, treefall gap formation and recruitment are the critical phenomena in the genesis of tropical rain forests. These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 106 light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.},

abstract = {The decline of biodiversity with latitude has received great attention, but both the concise pattern and the causes of the gradient are under strong debate. Most studies of the latitudinal gradient comprise only one or few organism types and are often restricted to certain region or habitat types. To test for significant variation in the gradient between organisms, habitats, or regions, a meta-analysis was conducted on nearly 600 latitudinal gradients assembled from the literature. Each gradient was characterized by two effect sizes, strength (correlation coefficient) and slope, and additionally by 14 variables describing organisms, habitats, and regions. The analysis corroborated the high generality of the latitudinal diversity decline. Gradients on regional scales were significantly stronger and steeper than on local scales, and slopes also varied with sampling grain. Both strength and slope increased with organism body mass, and strength increased with trophic level. The body mass-effect size relation varied for ecto- versus homeotherm organisms and for different dispersal types, suggesting allometric effects on energy use and dispersal ability as possible mechanisms for the body mass effect. Latitudinal gradients were weaker and less steep in freshwater than in marine or terrestrial environments and differed significantly between continents and habitat types. The gradient parameters were not affected by hemisphere or the latitudinal range covered. This analysis is the first to describe these general and significant patterns, which have important consequences for models aiming to explain the latitudinal gradient.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology. Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, from acquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels to more conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

@article{Stubbs2004,
abstract = {* 1We sought evidence among the plant species of a New Zealand sand dune community that limiting similarity controls the ability of species to coexist. Sampling was at four spatial scales, from a single point up to a scale of 50 m2. Twenty-three functional characters were measured on each of the species, covering the morphology of the shoot and root systems and nutrient status, and intended to represent modes of resource acquisition. * 2Patterns of association between plant species at the four scales were examined for any tendency for plants with similar functional characters to coexist less often than expected at random (e.g. if a point has three species, do they have notably different characters?) The observed results were compared with the patterns expected under a null model using a range of test statistics. * 3A test over all characters found that the mean dissimilarity between nearest-neighbour species in functional space, and the minimum dissimilarity, were greater than expected under the null model at the 0.5 × 0.5 m scale. This supports the MacArthur {\&} Levins model, although the actual community did not show an even spread of species over functional space. * 4Limiting similarity effects were seen even more consistently in separate characters when within-species variation was taken into account to calculate measures of overlap. The characters involved were mainly those related to rooting patterns and leaf water control, and thus perhaps reflecting the acquisition of nutrients and/or water. * 5Our results seem to be amongst the most convincing support for the theory of limiting similarity, and the only example involving vegetative processes in plant communities. The characters involved suggest that species can more readily coexist if they differ in their water-use pattern, reducing competition between them.},

@article{Swenson2009,
abstract = {Species diversity is promoted and maintained by ecological and evolutionary processes operating on species attributes through space and time. The degree to which variability in species function regulates distribution and promotes coexistence of species has been debated. Previous work has attempted to quantify the relative importance of species function by using phylogenetic relatedness as a proxy for functional similarity. The key assumption of this approach is that function is phylogenetically conserved. If this assumption is supported, then the phylogenetic dispersion in a community should mirror the functional dispersion. Here we quantify functional trait dispersion along several key axes of tree life-history variation and on multiple spatial scales in a Neotropical dry-forest community. We next compare these results to previously reported patterns of phylogenetic dispersion in this same forest. We find that, at small spatial scales, coexisting species are typically more functionally clustered than expected, but traits related to adult and regeneration niches are overdispersed. This outcome was repeated when the analyses were stratified by size class. Some of the trait dispersion results stand in contrast to the previously reported phylogenetic dispersion results. In order to address this inconsistency we examined the strength of phylogenetic signal in traits at different depths in the phylogeny. We argue that: (1) while phylogenetic relatedness may be a good general multivariate proxy for ecological similarity, it may have a reduced capacity to depict the functional mechanisms behind species coexistence when coexisting species simultaneously converge and diverge in function; and (2) the previously used metric of phylogenetic signal provided erroneous inferences about trait dispersion when married with patterns of phylogenetic dispersion.},

abstract = {One of the oldest ecological hypotheses, proposed by Darwin, suggests that the struggle for existence is stronger between more closely related species. Despite its long history, the validity of this phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis has rarely been examined. Here we provided a formal experimental test of the hypothesis using pairs of bacterivorous protist species in a multigenerational experiment. Consistent with the hypothesis, both the frequency and tempo of competitive exclusion, and the reduction in the abundance of inferior competitors, increased with increasing phylogenetic relatedness of the competing species. These results were linked to protist mouth size, a trait potentially related to resource use, exhibiting a significant phylogenetic signal. The likelihood of coexistence, however, was better predicted by phylogenetic relatedness than trait similarity of the competing species. Our results support phylogenetic relatedness as a useful predictor of the outcomes of competitive interactions in ecological communities.},

Boosted trees are a statistical learning method that attains both of these objectives for regression and classification analyses. They can deal with many types of response variables (numeric, categorical, and censored), loss functions (Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, and robust), and predictors (numeric, categorical). Interactions between predictors can also be quantified and visualized. The theory underpinning boosted trees is presented, together with interpretive techniques. A new form of boosted trees, namely, "aggregated boosted trees" (ABT), is proposed and, in a simulation study, is shown to reduce prediction error relative to boosted trees. A regression data set is analyzed using ABT to illustrate the technique and to compare it with other methods, including boosted trees, bagged trees, random forests, and generalized additive models. A software package for ABT analysis using the R software environment is included in the Appendices together with worked examples.},

abstract = {Prediction of species' distributions is central to diverse applications in ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to inform a range of ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications. However, users often underesti- mate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detec- tion and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conserva- tion applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simula- tions reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

abstract = {Many ideas have been advanced regarding how trees affect soils. Enough evidence is now available to evaluate the strength of these ideas and to consider interactions between tree species and soils in an evolutionary context. Forest floor mass commonly differs by about 20{\%} for different species growing on the same site; differences of up to 5-fold have been reported. Litterfall mass and N content commonly differ by 20 to 30{\%}, but larger differences are also common (especially with N-fixing species). The net mineralizaton of soil N typically differs by 50{\%} or more among species, indicating very strong feedback possibilities. We evaluate the evolutionary context of tree effects on soils by considering 3 degrees of coupling of trees to soils: tightly woven connections where the fitness of the tree is enhanced by its effect on soils; loosely woven interactions where selection for tree fitness unrelated to soil properties leads to indirect effects on soils (either enhancing or impairing fitness); and frayed interactions where the effects of trees on soil derive from features of the ecosystem that do not involve direct selection for tree fitness. Evidence supports each of these degrees of interaction for at least some cases, and no single context explains all the interactions between trees and soils. Important areas for further work include: next-generation assessments of the effects of trees on soil suitability for the same (and different) species, and the role of soil organisms in developing and modifying the effects of trees on soils.},

abstract = {Multivariate analyses are important tools for the biological assessment of ecological communities. Despite the popularity of multivariate analyses in bioassessments, there is considerable controversy over how to treat rare species. As this debate remains unresolved, the objective of this study was to develop a methodology to quantify the impacts of removing rare species relative to other decisions inherent in multivariate analyses and to provide insight into their relative influence in our studies. Using fish species from a well-sampled system, we assessed the impact of several choices common to multivariate analyses, including the removal of rare species, ordination technique and measures of multivariate resemblance. Comparisons of multivariate analyses demonstrated the choice of ordination method explained 26{\%} of the variation among the various results, followed by the choices regarding the removal of rare species (24.8{\%}) and resemblance measure (11{\%}). At the same time, the removal of rare species had important site-level impacts relative to full dataset, including a {\textgreater}9 fold change in sites impacted by the removal of single species, with an emphasis on removing species more correlated to anthropogenic stress. Our study demonstrates that the removal of rare species had similar or greater influence in multivariate analyses as other choices inherent in their calculation, such as the choice of ordination method. Better justifications for the removal of rare species, along with all decisions in multivariate analyses, are needed to move bioassessments forward. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we explore the idea of combining species-specific models into a single hierarchical model. The community component of the model seeks for shared patterns in how the species respond to environmental covariates. We illustrate the modeling framework in the context of logistic regression and presence–absence data, but a similar hierarchical structure could also be used in many other types of applications. We first use simulated data to illustrate that the community component can improve parameterization of species-specific models especially for rare species, for which the data would be too sparse to be informative alone. We then apply the community model to real data on 500 diatom species to show that it has much greater predictive power than a collection of independent species-specific models.

abstract = {Issues of residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) and spatial scale are critical to the study of species-environment relationships, because RSA invalidates many statistical procedures, while the scale of analysis affects the quantification of these relationships. Although these issues independently are widely covered in the literature, only sparse attention is given to their integration. This paper focuses on the interplay between RSA and the spatial scaling of species-environment relationships. Using a hypothetical species in an artificial landscape, we show that a mismatch between the scale of analysis and the scale of a species' response to its environment leads to a decrease in the portion of variation explained by environmental predictors. Moreover, it results in RSA and biased regression coefficients. This bias stems from error-predictor dependencies due to the scale mismatch, the magnitude of which depends on the interaction between the scale of landscape heterogeneity and the scale of a species' response to this heterogeneity. We show that explicitly considering scale effects on RSA can reveal the characteristic scale of a species' response to its environment. This is important, because the estimation of species-environment relationships using spatial regression methods proves to be erroneous in case of a scale mismatch, leading to spurious conclusions when scaling issues are not explicitly considered. The findings presented here highlight the importance of examining the appropriateness of the spatial scales used in analyses, since scale mismatches affect the rigor of statistical analyses and thereby the ability to understand the processes underlying spatial patterning in ecological phenomena.},

abstract = {Aim To test the hypothesis that plant species with a higher dispersal ability have a lower beta diversity. Location North America north of Mexico. Method Propagules of pteridophytes (ferns and their allies) are more vagile than propagules of spermatophytes (gymnosperms and angiosperms), and thus pterido- phytes have a higher dispersal ability than do spermatophytes. The study area was divided into 71 geographical units distributed in five latitudinal zones. Species lists of pteridophytes and spermatophytes were compiled for each geographical unit. Three measures of beta diversity were used: $\beta$ sim index of similarity, $\beta$ slope , which is one minus the Simpson index and geographical distance, and $\beta$ 0.5-distance similarity from its initial value. Results Average $\beta$ sim , which is the slope of the relationship between Simpson , which is the distance that halves the is higher for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes, regardless of whether the data are analysed for the whole continent or for latitudinal zones. Average $\beta$ sim phytes. The difference in average $\beta$ sim decreases with increasing latitude for both spermatophytes and pterido- between the two plant groups increases with increasing latitude, indicating that beta diversity decreases with increasing latitude faster for pteridophytes than for spermatophytes. When the Simpson index is regressed against geographical distance, the regression slope ( $\beta$ slope ) is steeper for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes, and the slope decreases with increasing latitude for both plant groups. Similarly, $\beta$ 0.5-distance was shorter for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes in each latitudinal zone and increased with increasing latitude for both plant groups. The results of the analyses using the three different measures of beta diversity are consistent. Main conclusions The fact that beta diversity is lower for pteridophytes with vagile propagules than for spermatophytes with less vagile propagules suggests that beta diversity is negatively related to dispersal ability.},

abstract = {The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site. We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm-index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached. Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80{\%} of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant-pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Metacommunity theory predicts that increasing patch size and patch connectivity can alter local species diversity by affecting either colonization rates, extinction rates or both. Although species' dispersal abilities or ‘dispersal mode' (e.g. gravity-, wind- or animal-dispersed seeds) can mediate the effects of patch size and connectivity on diversity, these important factors are frequently overlooked in empirical metacommunity work.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We use a natural metacommunity of aspen stands within a grassland matrix to determine whether dispersal mode alters the influence of stand size and connectivity on understorey plant diversity. We sampled the same area in each patch, controlled for the presence of matrix species in aspen stands, and tested for the effects of size, connectivity and dispersal mode on metacommunity richness. Because dispersal groups responded differently to patch size and connectivity, we created a null model and assessed ungulate activity to explore whether competitive dynamics or herbivory were driving diversity patterns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Animal-dispersed species and species with no dispersal aid had higher diversity per unit area in larger stands, likely because large stands can both support larger populations that are less prone to extinction and may also attract seed-dispersing animals such as birds and small mammals that are sensitive to edge effects. Consistent with other empirical work, we found a positive relationship between diversity and connectivity for wind-dispersed species. However, we detected a negative effect of stand connectivity on the diversity of species with no dispersal aid, possibly due to the presence of other highly competitive species groups dominating well-connected patches, as our null model results suggest. We found no evidence for higher ungulate activity in highly connected patches, suggesting that herbivory may not be driving the decline in diversity of plants with no dispersal aid.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Synthesis. Overall, we see a positive effect of stand area on diversity for most groups despite sampling equal area in all stands, which is a prediction of metacommunity theory that is normally overlooked. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering variation in the dispersal modes of focal species for explaining the diversity patterns of natural metacommunities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Ecologists use approaches based on plant functional traits to tackle several fundamental and applied questions. Although a perfect characterization of functional trait structure requires the measurement of all the individuals in communities, this is prohibitively resource-consuming. Consequently, the general practice is to average the trait values of a reduced number of individuals per species. However, there are different alternatives regarding the number, identity and spatial location of the individuals chosen to calculate species-averaged trait values. In this study, we compared different strategies for sampling functional traits, using community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and the Rao index of functional diversity (FD). We intensively sampled the functional trait structure along a topographical gradient in a Mediterranean grassland, obtaining accurate estimations of the ‘real' values of these indices (CWMI and FDI) for three traits (height, leaf area and specific leaf area). We simulated three different sampling strategies differing in the spatial location of the individuals used to estimate species-mean trait: (i) average of the whole gradient (GLO), (ii) average of the sampling unit in which the abundances of species maximize (MAX) and (iii) average of a reduced number of individuals per species and sampling unit (LOC). For each strategy, we simulated different sampling intensities (number of individuals sampled). For each trait, we examined the ability of each strategy and sampling intensity to accurately estimate CWMI and FDI, as well as their ability to detect changes in functional trait structure along the topographical gradient. LOC outperformed the other strategies in terms of accuracy and bias, and was much more efficient to describe changes along the gradient, regardless of the traits and indicators considered. Furthermore, LOC was the only strategy that improved consistently as sampling intensity increased, especially at low levels of intensity. Our results indicate that the impact of considering intraspecific variability in trait values can be greater than commonly assumed. Strategies that neglect this source of variability can result in inaccurate or biased estimations of the functional trait structure of plant communities. Most importantly, we show that intraspecific variability can be taken into consideration without any increases in the total number of individuals measured.},

abstract = {An understanding of how the degree of phylogenetic relatedness influences the ecological similarity among species is crucial to inferring the mechanisms governing the assembly of communities. We evaluated the relative importance of spider phylogenetic relationships and ecological niche (plant morphological variables) to the variation in spider body size and shape by comparing spiders at different scales: (i) between bromeliads and dicot plants (i.e., habitat scale) and (ii) among bromeliads with distinct architectural features (i.e., microhabitat scale). We partitioned the interspecific variation in body size and shape into phylogenetic (that express trait values as expected by phylogenetic relationships among species) and ecological components (that express trait values independent of phylogenetic relationships). At the habitat scale, bromeliad spiders were larger and flatter than spiders associated with the surrounding dicots. At this scale, plant morphology sorted out close related spiders. Our results showed that spider flatness is phylogenetically clustered at the habitat scale, whereas it is phylogenetically overdispersed at the microhabitat scale, although phylogenic signal is present in both scales. Taken together, these results suggest that whereas at the habitat scale selective colonization affect spider body size and shape, at fine scales both selective colonization and adaptive evolution determine spider body shape. By partitioning the phylogenetic and ecological components of phenotypic variation, we were able to disentangle the evolutionary history of distinct spider traits and show that plant architecture plays a role in the evolution of spider body size and shape. We also discussed the relevance in considering multiple scales when studying phylogenetic community structure.},

abstract = {A research program in ecophylogenetics integrates phylogenetic hypotheses, trait data, and environmental variables to explain local community assembly. Its core idea lies in the use of phylogenies as a proxy for ecological resemblance among members of a community. This rationale is embodied in the “competition-relatedness hypothesis”, which posits that related species are more prone to compete for resources and this process should limit the number of co-occurring species. Concurrently, the research tradition in trait-based community assembly has posed a large importance on the role of environmental filters in determining local species composition. However, despite great methodological advances in the last decade, empirical evidence for the prominence of either process has been mixed. Recent studies have pointed out to the need to test explicitly the assumption of trait conservatism and also to incorporate other mechanisms of species coexistence (e.g., differences in competitive hierarchy and niche segregation) into the basic framework. Here, I review the core ideas of ecophylogenetics and discuss the recent criticism regarding their assumptions and the mechanisms regulating species coexistence. I also highlight recent trends and promising topics. For instance, a phylogenetic approach may be useful in solving long-standing questions in ecology, such as the latitudinal species richness gradient and the relationship biodiversity-ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {AimsAlthough the niche concept is of prime importance in ecology, the quantification of plant species' niches remains difficult. Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients. Important findingsUnder this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.},

abstract = {AimsWhile using phylogenetic and functional approaches to test the mechanisms of community assembly, functional traits often act as the proxy of niches. However, there is little detailed knowledge regarding the correlation between functional traits of tree species and their niches in local communities. We suggest that the co-varying correlation between functional traits and niches should be the premise for using phylogenetic and functional approaches to test mechanisms of community assembly. Using functional traits, phylogenetic and environmental data, this study aims to answer the questions: (i) within local communities, do functional traits of co-occurring species co-vary with their environmental niches at the species level? and (ii) what is the key ecological process underlying community assembly in Xishuangbanna and Ailaoshan forest dynamic plots (FDPs)? MethodsWe measured seven functional traits of 229 and 36 common species in Xishuangbanna and Ailaoshan FDPs in tropical and subtropical China, respectively. We also quantified the environmental niches for these species based on conditional probability. We then analyzed the correlations between functional traits and environmental niches using phylogenetic independent contrasts. After examining phylogenetic signals of functional traits using Pagel's {\{}lambda{\}}, we quantified the phylogenetic and functional dispersion along environmental gradients within local tree communities. Important FindingsFor target species, functional traits do co-vary with environmental niches at the species level in both of the FDPs, supporting that functional traits can be used as a proxy for local-scale environmental niches. Functional traits show significant phylogenetic signals in both of the FDPs. We found that the phylogenetic and functional dispersion were significantly clustered along topographical gradients in the Ailaoshan FDP but overdispersion in the Xishuangbanna FDP. These patterns of phylogenetic and functional dispersion suggest that environmental filtering plays a key role in structuring local tree assemblages in Ailaoshan FDP, while competition exclusion plays a key role in Xishuangbanna FDP.},

abstract = {One of the key problems in ecology is our need to anticipate the set of locations in which a species will be found (hereafter species' distributions). A major source of uncertainty in these models is the role of interactions among species (hereafter biotic interactions). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly study this problem at large spatial scales and we lack a clear understanding of when biotic interactions shape species' distributions. We show a simple, direct link between the ease of species' coexistence and the importance of competition for shaping species' distributions. We show that increasing the ease of species' coexistence reduces the influence of biotic interactions. Changing the spatial scale of the analysis can reduce the influence of species interactions, but only when it promotes regional coexistence. Using these ideas, we analyze the conditions under which biotic interactions alter species' distributions in a Lotka–Volterra model of competition along an environmental gradient and argue that coexistence theory, rather than scale alone, provides a guide to the influence of species interactions. Our results provide a guide to the facets of biotic interactions that are necessary to anticipate their effects on species distributions. As such, we expect our work will help the development of more realistic distribution models.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

abstract = {Differential coexistence among species underlies geographical patterns of biodiversity. Understanding such patterns has relied either on ecological or historical approaches applied separately. Recently, macroecology and community phylogenetics have tried to integrate both ecological and historical approaches. However, macroecology is mostly non-phylogenetic, whereas community phylogenetics is largely focused on local scales. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to link macroecology and community phylogenetics by exploring the evolutionary context of large-scale species coexistence, introducing the phylogenetic field concept. This is defined as the phylogenetic structure of species co-occurrence within a focal species' geographical range. We developed concepts and methods for analysing phylogenetic fields and applied them to study coexistence patterns of the bat family Phyllostomidae. Our analyses showed that phyllostomid bats coexist mostly with closely related species, revealing a north-south gradient from overdispersed to clustered phylogenetic fields. Patterns at different phylogenetic levels (i.e. all species versus close relatives only) presented the same gradient. Results support the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis, potentially mediated by higher speciation rates in the region of origin coupled with shared environmental preferences among species. The phylogenetic field approach enables species-based community phylogenetics, instead of those that are site-based, allowing the description of historical processes at more appropriate macroecological and biogeographic scales.},

abstract = {AimsEnvironmental gradients are drivers of species diversity; however, we know relatively little about the evolutionary processes underlying these relationships. A potentially powerful approach to studying diversity gradients is to quantify the phylogenetic structure within and between assemblages arrayed along broad spatial and environmental gradients. Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages along an environmental gradient with the expectation that the habitat specialization of entire lineages is an important evolutionary pattern influencing the structure of tree communities along environmental gradients. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of several environmental variables on the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages in 145 plots distributed in northwestern South America that cover a broad environmental gradient. The phylogenetic alpha diversity was quantified for each plot and the phylogenetic beta diversity between each pair of plots was also quantified. Both the alpha and beta diversity measures were then related to spatial and environmental gradients in the study system. Important FindingsWe found that gradients in temperature and potential evapotranspiration have a strong relationship with the phylogenetic alpha diversity in our study system, with phylogenetic overdispersion in low temperatures and phylogenetic clustering at higher temperatures. Further, the phylogenetic beta diversity between two plots increases with an increasing difference in temperature, whereas annual precipitation was not a significant predictor of community phylogenetic turnover. We also found that the phylogenetic structure of the plots in our study system was related to the degree of seasonal flooding and seasonality in precipitation. In particular, more stressful environments such as dry forests and flooded forests showed phylogenetic clustering. Finally, in contrast with previous studies, we find that phylogenetic beta diversity was not strongly related to the spatial distance separating two forest plots, which may be the result of the importance of the three independent mountain ranges in our study system, which generate a high degree of environmental variation over very short distances. In conclusion, we found that environmental gradients are important drivers of both phylogenetic alpha and phylogenetic beta diversities in these forests over spatial distance.},

abstract = {Assessing the overall biological diversity of tropical rain forests is a seemingly insurmountable task for ecologists. Therefore, researchers frequently sample selected taxa that they believe reflect general biodiversity patterns. Usually, these studies focus on the congruence of $\alpha$ diversity (the number of species found per sampling unit) between taxa rather than on ? diversity (turnover of species assemblages between sampling units). Such approaches ignore the potential role of habitat heterogeneity that, depending on the taxonomic group considered, can greatly enhance ? diversity at local and landscape scales. We compared $\alpha$ and ? diversity of four plant groups (trees, lianas, terrestrial herbs, epiphytic liverworts) and eight animal groups (birds, butterflies, lower canopy ants, lower canopy beetles, dung beetles, bees, wasps, and the parasitoids of the latter two) at 15 sites in Sulawesi, Indonesia, that represented natural rain forest and three types of cacao agroforests differing in management intensity. In total, we recorded 863 species. Patterns of species richness per study site varied strongly between taxonomic groups. Only 13?17{\%} of the variance in species richness of one taxonomic group could be predicted from the species richness of another, and on average 12?18{\%} of the variance of ? diversity of a given group was predicted by that in other groups, although some taxon pairs had higher values (up to 76{\%} for wasps and their parasitoids). The degree of congruence of patterns of $\alpha$ diversity was not influenced by sampling completeness, whereas the indicator value for ? diversity improved when using a similarity index that accounts for incomplete sampling. The indication potential of $\alpha$ diversity for ? diversity and vice versa was limited within taxa (7?20{\%}) and virtually nil between them (0?4{\%}). We conclude that different taxa can have largely independent patterns of $\alpha$ diversity and that patterns of ? diversity can be more congruent. Thus, conservation plans on a landscape scale need to put more emphasis on the high heterogeneity of agroforests and the overarching role of ? diversity shaping overall diversity patterns.},

abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implica- tions for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies},

abstract = {A unified theory in science is a theory that shows a common underlying set of rules that regulate processes previously thought to be distinct. Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that spatial distribution of biodiversity is strongly driven by community assembly processes. Thus the study of diversity patterns combined with null model testing has become increasingly common to infer assembly processes from observed distributions of diversity indices. However, results in both empirical and simulation studies are inconsistent. The aim of our study is to determine with simulated data which facets of biodiversity, if any, may unravel the processes driving its spatial patterns, and to provide practical considerations about the combination of diversity indices that would produce significant and congruent signals when using null models. The study is based on simulated species' assemblages that emerge under various landscape structures in a spatially explicit individual-based model with contrasting, predefined assembly processes. We focus on four assembly processes (species-sorting, mass effect, neutral dynamics and competition colonization trade-off) and investigate the emerging species' distributions with varied diversity indices (alpha, beta and gamma) measured at different spatial scales and for different diversity facets (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We find that 1) the four assembly processes result in distinct spatial distributions of species under any landscape structure, 2) a broad range of diversity indices allows distinguishing between communities driven by different assembly processes, 3) null models provide congruent results only for a small fraction of diversity indices and 4) only a combination of these diversity indices allows identifying the correct assembly processes. Our study supports the inference of assembly processes from patterns of diversity only when different types of indices are combined. It highlights the need to combine phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity indices at multiple spatial scales to effectively infer underlying assembly processes from diversity patterns by illustrating how combination of different indices might help disentangling the complex question of coexistence. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Species spatial turnover, or beta-diversity, induces a decay of community similarity with geographic distance known as the distance-decay relationship. Although this relationship is central to biodiversity and biogeography, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a general framework to describe how the distance-decay relationship is influenced by population aggregation and the landscape-scale species-abundance distribution. We utilize this general framework and data from three tropical forests to show that rare species have a weak influence on distance-decay curves, and that overall similarity and rates of decay are primarily influenced by species abundances and population aggregation respectively. We illustrate the utility of the framework by deriving an exact analytical expression of the distance-decay relationship when population aggregation is characterized by the Poisson Cluster Process. Our study provides a foundation for understanding the distance-decay relationship, and for predicting and testing patterns of beta-diversity under competing theories in ecology.},

abstract = {R. H. Whittaker's idea that plant diversity can be divided into a hierarchy of spatial components from alpha at the within-habitat scale through beta for the turnover of species between habitats to gamma along regional gradients implies the underlying existence of alpha, beta, and gamma niches. We explore the hypothesis that the evolution of alpha, beta, and gamma niches is also hierarchical, with traits that define the alpha niche being labile, while those defining beta and gamma niches are conservative. At the alpha level we find support for the hypothesis in the lack of close significant phylogenetic relationship between meadow species that have similar alpha niches. In a second test, alpha niche overlap based on a variety of traits is compared between congeners and noncongeners in several communities; here, too, there is no evidence of a correlation between alpha niche and phylogeny. To test whether beta and gamma niches evolve conservatively, we reconstructed the evolution of relevant traits on evolutionary trees for 14 different clades. Tests against null models revealed a number of instances, including some in island radiations, in which habitat (beta niche) and elevational maximum (an aspect of the gamma niche) showed evolutionary conservatism.},

abstract = {Modern attempts to produce biogeographic maps focus on the distribution of species, and the maps are typically drawn without phylogenetic considerations. Here, we generate a global map of zoogeographic regions by combining data on the distributions and phylogenetic relationships of 21,037 species of amphibians, birds, and mammals. We identify 20 distinct zoogeographic regions, which are grouped into 11 larger realms. We document the lack of support for several regions previously defined based on distributional data and show that spatial turnover in the phylogenetic composition of vertebrate assemblages is higher in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. We further show that the integration of phylogenetic information provides valuable insight on historical relationships among regions, permitting the identification of evolutionarily unique regions of the world.},

abstract = {Plant diversity, like that of most other taxonomic groups, peaks in the tropics, where climatic conditions are warm and wet, and it declines toward the temperate and polar zones as conditions become colder and drier, with more seasonally variable temperatures. Climate and evolutionary history are often considered competing explanations for the latitudinal gradient, but they are linked by the evolutionarily conserved environmental adaptations of species and the history of Earth's climate system. The tropical conservatism hypothesis (TCH) invokes niche conservatism, climatic limitations on establishment and survival, and paleoclimatic history to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient. Here, we use latitudinal distributions for over 12,500 woody angiosperm species, a fossil-calibrated supertree, and null modeling to test predictions of the TCH. Regional assemblages in the northern and southern temperate zones are less phylogenetically diverse than expected based on their species richness, because temperate taxa are clustered into relatively few clades. Moreover, lineages with temperate affinities are generally younger and nested within older, more tropical lineages. As predicted by the TCH, the vast majority of temperate lineages have arisen since global cooling began at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (34 Mya). By linking physiological tolerances of species to evolutionary and biogeographic processes, phylogenetic niche conservatism may provide a theoretical framework for a generalized explanation for Earth's predominant pattern of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Plants, with an estimated 300,000 species, provide crucial primary production and ecosystem structure. To date, our quantitative understanding of diversity gradients of megadiverse clades such as plants has been hampered by the paucity of distribution data. Here, we investigate the global-scale species-richness pattern of vascular plants and examine its environmental and potential historical determinants. Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness. After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor model explains approximately 70{\%} of the global variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act synergistically with water-energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

abstract = {The area of occupancy of a species and its abundance are dependent on the spatial scale at which they are measured. However, it is less obvious how the scale of sampling affects their correlation. This study investigated and modeled the effects of sampling unit size and areal extent on the interspecific occupancy-abundance relationships for a tropical tree species assemblage at a local scale and a temperate bird species assemblage at a regional scale. The results showed that both sampling unit size and study extent had profound quantitative effects on the occupancy-abundance relationship, although it remained positive. Several properties of the occupaney-abundance relationship can result from the effects of scale: 1) the linearity of the relationship decreases with the increase of sampling unit size; 2) for a given abundance, the area of occupancy increases with sampling unit size; and 3) variation in the area of occupancy increases with the increase of both sampling unit size and extent, and if the extent is large enough may be sufficient that no occupancy-abundance relationship is observed. Although the occupancy-abundance relationship can be satisfactorily modeled, the parameters depend on the scale used. This suggests that a model derived from one scale cannot be applied to another. In other words, to estimate the rarity or commonness of species using such a model, the estimation must be strictly done using the same sampling scale for all the species},

abstract = {SUMMARY$\backslash$nOne of the most general patterns in community ecology is the positive relationship between the number of sites or areas in which a species in a taxonomic assemblage occurs regionally and its local abundance. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this interspecific occupancy-abundance relationship, but it has recently been argued that the pattern is most profitably viewed as a consequence of the spatial distribution of the individuals of each species. In this paper we explore the link between spatial distribution and the occupancy-abundance relationship, with particular reference to statistical models that have been suggested to describe the pattern, and discuss its connections with a broad understanding of how organisms are distributed in space. A range of models describe observed occupancy-abundance relationships reasonably well, but are commonly not well differentiated over the range of abundances implicit in such relationships. There is little evidence that species exhibit great commonality in the form of their aggregative behaviour, but this does not matter in terms of the generation of a positive interspecific occupancy-abundance relationship. Eines der allgemeinsten Muster in der {\"{O}}kologie der Lebensgemeinschaften ist die Beziehung zwischen der Anzahl der Standorte oder Gebiete, an oder in denen Arten einer taxonomischen Gruppe vorkommmen, und ihrer lokalen Abundanz. Es wurde eine Anzahl von Hypothesen vorgeschlagen, um diese interspezifische Anwesenheits-Abundanz-Beziehung zu erkl{\"{a}}ren. In letzter Zeit wurde jedoch angef{\"{u}}hrt, dass dieses Muster mit dem besten Ergebnis als eine Folge der r{\"{a}}umlichen Verteilung der Individuen einer jeden Art zu sehen ist. In diesem Review erkunden wir die Verbindung zwischen der r{\"{a}}umlichen Verteilung und der Anwesenheits-Abundanz-Beziehung, wobei besonderer Wert auf die statistischen Modelle gelegt wird. Zudem er{\"{o}}rtern wir in welcher Beziehung sie zu einem breiten Verst{\"{a}}ndnis der Verteilung der Organismen im Raum steht. Eine Reihe von Modellen beschreibt die Anwesenheits-Abundanz-Beziehung relativ gut; sie sind aber meistens {\"{u}}ber den Bereich der Abundanzen, die in diesen Beziehungen vorkommen, nicht ausreichend differenziert. Es gibt nur wenige Beweise daf{\"{u}}r, dass die Arten eine gro{\ss}e Gemeinsamkeit in der Form ihres aggregierenden Verhaltens aufweisen.

abstract = {1 The distribution of relative abundances between the species of a plant community has been remarkably little analysed. We examine differences in relative abundance distribution (RAD) between different soil fertility levels, and trends through time in the development of a community, using data from three grassland experiments: Monks Wood grassland restoration, Park Grass long-term fertilizer trial and Compton grassland restoration. 2 Comparing plots with different fertilizer treatments, the evenness of plant species abundance was higher where phosphorus had been applied; other effects of soil fertility on evenness were inconsistent. There were no consistent effects of soil fertility on the relative fit of the Geometric, General Lognormal and Zipf-Mandelbrot models of RAD, contrary to previous theories, However, the Broken Stick model fitted relatively better, though still poorly in absolute terms, in plots with high species richness and where phosphorus had been applied. Parameter gamma of the General Log-normal distribution was higher in the high-nitrogen and species-poor plots, disproving the theory that gamma should be constant, Parameter beta of the Zipf-Mandelbrot model was higher in more species-rich and in high-phosphorus plots, a result not predicted in the literature. The variation in gamma and beta seems to be largely a reflection of the variation in evenness and in species dominance. The consistency in species dominance across space (rank consistency) was higher in plots with phosphorus addition. It is concluded that resource availability had little effect on which model of community assembly fitted, However, under high phosphorus conditions the community was more spatially consistent, and there was less dominance. 3 Through time, the evenness of species abundances increased, consistently between two separate experiments, Examining the shape of the abundance distribution at a more detailed level, there were no time trends in which relative abundance model fitted best, except that the fit of the Broken Stick model became less poor, However, the shape of the General Log-normal and Zipf-Mandelbrot curves, as seen in indices gamma and beta, respectively, changed through time, consistently between two separate experiments, supporting the implication from increased evenness of increasing niche diversification. Rank consistency increased in the early years of succession, then decreased, supporting the Three-phase succession model of Gitay {\&} Wilson (1995), in which a middle `building' phase has higher rank consistency than the preceding `pioneer' phase or the succeeding `mature' phase.},

In Brazil, climatology has been studied for more than 140 years, and among the many proposed methods Ko ¨ppen0s system remains as the most utilized. Considering Ko ¨ppen's climate classification importance for Brazil (geography, biology, ecology, meteorology, hydrology, agronomy, forestry and environmental sciences), we developed a geographical information system to identify Ko ¨ppen's climate types based on monthly temperature and rainfall data from 2,950 weather stations. Temperature maps were spatially described using multivariate equations that took into account the geographical coordinates and altitude; and the map resolution (100 m) was similar to the digital elevation model derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Patterns of rainfall were interpolated using kriging, with the same resolution of temperature maps. The final climate map obtained for Brazil (851,487,700 ha) has a high spatial resolution (1 ha) which allows to observe the climatic variations at the landscape level. The results are presented as maps, graphs, diagrams and tables, allowing users to interpret the occurrence of climate types in Brazil. The zones and climate types are referenced to the most important mountains, plateaus and depressions, geographical landmarks, rivers and watersheds and major cities across the country making the information accessible to all levels of users. The climate map not only showed that the A, B and C zones represent approximately 81{\%}, 5{\%} and 14{\%} of the country but also allowed the identification of Ko ¨ppen's climates types never reported before in Brazil.},

abstract = {AIM: Phylogenetic diversity patterns are increasingly being used to better understand the role of ecological and evolutionary processes in community assembly. Here, we quantify how these patterns are influenced by scale choices in terms of spatial and environmental extent and organismic scales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLOCATION: European Alps.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We applied 42 sampling strategies differing in their combination of focal scales. For each resulting sub-dataset, we estimated the phylogenetic diversity of the species pools, phylogenetic $\alpha$-diversities of local communities, and statistics commonly used together with null models in order to infer non-random diversity patterns (i.e. phylogenetic clustering versus over-dispersion). Finally, we studied the effects of scale choices on these measures using regression analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Scale choices were decisive for revealing signals in diversity patterns. Notably, changes in focal scales sometimes reversed a pattern of over-dispersion into clustering. Organismic scale had a stronger effect than spatial and environmental extent. However, we did not find general rules for the direction of change from over-dispersion to clustering with changing scales. Importantly, these scale issues had only a weak influence when focusing on regional diversity patterns that change along abiotic gradients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results call for caution when combining phylogenetic data with distributional data to study how and why communities differ from random expectations of phylogenetic relatedness. These analyses seem to be robust when the focus is on relating community diversity patterns to variation in habitat conditions, such as abiotic gradients.

@book{Banerjee2004,
abstract = {Among the many uses of hierarchical modeling, their application to the statistical analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data from areas such as epidemiology And environmental science has proven particularly fruitful. Yet to date, the few books that address the subject have been either too narrowly focused on specific aspects of spatial analysis, or written at a level often inaccessible to those lacking a strong background in mathematical statistics.Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data is the first accessible, self-contained treatment of hierarchical methods, modeling, and data analysis for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Starting with overviews of the types of spatial data, the data analysis tools appropriate for each, and a brief review of the Bayesian approach to statistics, the authors discuss hierarchical modeling for univariate spatial response data, including Bayesian kriging and lattice (areal data) modeling. They then consider the problem of spatially misaligned data, methods for handling multivariate spatial responses, spatio-temporal models, and spatial survival models. The final chapter explores a variety of special topics, including spatially varying coefficient models.This book provides clear explanations, plentiful illustrations --some in full color--a variety of homework problems, and tutorials and worked examples using some of the field's most popular software packages.. Written by a team of leaders in the field, it will undoubtedly remain the primary textbook and reference on the subject for years to come.},

abstract = {The fact that temperate grasslands often contain upwards of 30 vascular plant species per m(2) yet these species seem to have relatively similar life histories and resource requirements has made explaining species coexistence in these communities a major focus of research. While the reduction of competition by disturbance has been a popular explanation for species coexistence, in tallgrass prairies any level of disturbance either has no effect, or decreases diversity, since it favors the dominant plants. Although there has long been speculation that grassland species could coexist by niche partitioning the concept received renewed interest when it was shown that soil hydrology could explain species coexistence. One aspect of community structure that has not been explained by niche partitioning is the rareness and commonness of species within communities. There are three classes of explanations for rareness: narrow habitat requirements, low competitive ability combined with frequency dependent fitness and, dispersal ability. However, evidence for these explanations tend to be anecdotal, focusing on particular species. Here I show that in tallgrass prairies common and rare species consistently occupy different parts of niche space, with rare species being restricted by the cover of common species and occupying the rare available niches.},

abstract = {Variation partitioning of species composition into components explained by environmental and spatial variables is often used to identify a signature of niche- and dispersal-based processes in community assembly. Such interpretation, however, strongly depends on the quality of the environmental data available. In recent studies conducted in forest dynamics plots, the environment was represented only by readily available topographical variables. Using data from a subtropical broad-leaved dynamics plot in Taiwan, we focus on the question of how would the conclusion about importance of niche- and dispersal-based processes change if soil variables are also included in the analysis. To gain further insight, we introduced multiscale decomposition of a pure spatial component [c] in variation partitioning. Our results indicate that, if only topography is included, dispersal-based processes prevail, while including soil variables reverses this conclusion in favor of niche-based processes. Multiscale decomposition of [c] shows that if only topography was included, broad-scaled spatial variation prevails in [c], indicating that other as yet unmeasured environmental variables can be important. However, after also including soil variables this pattern disappears, increasing importance of meso- and fine-scaled spatial patterns indicative of dispersal processes.},

abstract = {1. The mechanisms controlling soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation are crucial for explaining why soils are major terrestrial C sinks. Such mechanisms have been mainly addressed by imposing short-term, step-changes in CO 2 , temperature and N fertilization rates on either monocultures or low-diversity plant assemblages. No studies have addressed the long-term effects of plant functional diversity (i.e. plant functional composition) on rates of soil C accumulation in N-limited grasslands where fixation is the main source of N for plants. 2. Here we measure net soil C and N accumulation to 1 m soil-depth during a 12-year-long grassland biodiversity experiment established on agriculturally degraded soils at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. 3. We show that high-diversity mixtures of perennial grassland plant species stored 500{\%} and 600{\%} more soil C and N than, on average, did monoculture plots of the same species. More- over, the presence of C4 grasses and legumes increased soil C accumulation by 193{\%} and 522{\%}, respectively. Higher soil C and N accrual resulted both from increased C and N inputs via (i) higher root biomass, and (ii) from greater root biomass accumulation to 60 cm soil depth resulting from the presence of highly complementary functional groups (i.e. C4 grasses and legumes). 4. Our results suggest that the joint presence of C4 grass and legume species is a key cause of greater soil C and N accumulation in both higher and lower diversity plant assemblages. This is because legumes have unique access to N, and C4 grasses take up and use N efficiently, increasing below-ground biomass and thus soil C and N inputs. 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that plant functional complementarity is a key reason why higher plant diversity leads to greater soil C and N accumulation on agriculturally degraded soils. We suggest the combination of key C4 grass–legume species may greatly increase ecosystem services such as soil C accumulation and biomass (biofuel) production in both high- and low-diversity N-limited grassland systems.},

I suggest that the distributions of species within a region reveal more about the processes that generate diversity patterns than does the co-occurrence of species at any given point. The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally. Ecologists are moving toward a community concept based on interactions between populations over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales within entire regions, including the population and evolutionary processes that produce new species.},

abstract = {Spatial patterns of tree species were studied in a 50-ha tropical rain forest plot in the Pasoh forest, Malaysia. This forest is characterized by a high diversity and very high number of rare species. Out of the 745 species occurring with {\textgreater} five individuals, 80.4{\%} had an aggregated distribution, 19.5{\%} were randomly distributed and one species had a regular distribution. The spatial patterns of rare vs. common species, juvenile vs. adult trees, and coarse vs. fine scales were compared. Rare species are generally less aggregated than common ones and most of the randomly distributed species are rare. Spatial patterns shift from high clumping to looser intensity or random distribution when moving from juveniles to adults for the same species. No adult tree species display a regular pattern, however. Regular distributions were rarely found; this is probably due to intraspecific competition at a local scale. There is a negative correlation between per capita death rate and population density. This study suggests that the Pasoh forest and its high diversity are subjected to multiple controlling factors, e.g., topography, spacing effect, density-dependent processes and species rarity. The importance of any factor changes across spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Questions Soil properties have been widely shown to influence plant growth and distribution. However, the degree to which edaphic variables can improve models based on topo-climatic variables is still unclear. In this study, we tested the roles of seven edaphic variables, namely (1) pH; (2) the content of nitrogen and of (3) phosphorus; (4) silt; (5) sand; (6) clay and (7) carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, as predictors of species distribution models in an edaphically heterogeneous landscape. We also tested how the respective influence of these variables in the models is linked to different ecological and functional species characteristics. Location The Western Alps, Switzerland. Methods With four different modelling techniques, we built models for 115 plant species using topo-climatic variables alone and then topo-climatic variables plus each of the seven edaphic variables, one at a time. We evaluated the contribution of each edaphic variable by assessing the change in predictive power of the model. In a second step, we evaluated the importance of the two edaphic variables that yielded the largest increase in predictive power in one final set of models for each species. Third, we explored the change in predictive power and the importance of variables across plant functional groups. Finally, we assessed the influence of the edaphic predictors on the prediction of community composition by stacking the models for all species and comparing the predicted communities with the observed community. Results Among the set of edaphic variables studied, pH and nitrogen content showed the highest contributions to improvement of the predictive power of the models, as well as the predictions of community composition. When considering all topo-climatic and edaphic variables together, pH was the second most important variable after degree-days. The changes in model results caused by edaphic predictors were dependent on species characteristics. The predictions for the species that have a low specific leaf area, and acidophilic preferences, tolerating low soil pH and high humus content, showed the largest improvement by the addition of pH and nitrogen in the model. Conclusions pH was an important predictor variable for explaining species distribution and community composition of the mountain plants considered in our study. pH allowed more precise predictions for acidophilic species. This variable should not be neglected in the construction of species distribution models in areas with contrasting edaphic conditions},

abstract = {Grasslands are recognized as biodiversity hotspots in Europe. However, protection and management of these habitats are currently constrained by a limited understanding of what determines local grassland plant diversity patterns. Here, we combined vegetation records (8,639 inventory plots) from 258 semi-natural grasslands with fine-resolution topographic data based on light detection and ranging technology to investigate the importance of topography—particularly topographically controlled soil moisture—for local and regional grassland plant diversity patterns across a 43,000 km2 lowland region (Denmark). Specifically, we examined the relationships between five vegetation measures representing species composition and richness as well as functional composition (Ellenberg indicator values) and four functional topographic factors representing topographic wetness, potential solar radiation, heat balance and wind exposure. Topography emerged as an important determinant of diversity patterns in both wet and dry grasslands throughout the study region, with topographic wetness being the strongest correlate of the main local (within-site) and regional (among-sites) gradients in species composition and species' average preferences for soil moisture. Accordingly, topography plays an important role in shaping grassland plant diversity patterns both locally and regionally throughout this lowland European region, with this role mainly driven by topographically controlled soil moisture. These findings suggest hydrology to be important to consider in the planning and management of European grasslands.},

abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) holds the promise of providing natural scientists the capacity to evaluate complex multivariate hypotheses about ecological systems. Building on its predecessors, path analysis and factor analysis, SEM allows for the incorporation of both observed and unobserved (latent) variables into theoretically-based probabilistic models. In this paper we discuss the interface between theory and data in SEM and the use of an additional variable type, the composite. In simple terms, composite variables specify the influences of collections of other variables and can be helpful in modeling heterogeneous concepts of the sort commonly of interest to ecologists. While long recognized as a potentially important element of SEM, composite variables have received very limited use, in part because of a lack of theoretical consideration, but also because of difficulties that arise in parameter estimation when using conventional solution procedures. In this paper we present a framework for discussing composites and demonstrate how the use of partially-reduced-form models can help to overcome some of the parameter estimation and evaluation problems associated with models containing composites. Diagnostic procedures for evaluating the most appropriate and effective use of composites are illustrated with an example from the ecological literature. It is argued that an ability to incorporate composite variables into structural equation models may be particularly valuable in the study of natural systems, where concepts are frequently multifaceted and the influence of suites of variables are often of interest.},

abstract = {Serpentine vegetation in California ranges from forest to shrubland and grassland, harbors many rare and endemic species, and is only moderately altered by invasive exotic species at the present time. To better understand the factors regulating the distribution of common/ representative species, endemic/rare species, and the threat of exotics in this important flora, we analyzed broad-scale community patterns and environmental conditions in a geographically stratified set of samples from across the state. We considered three major classes of environmental influences: climate ( especially precipitation), soils ( especially the Mg2+/ Ca2+ ratio), and the indirect influences of climate on soils. We used ordination to identify the major axes of variation in common species abundances, structural equation models to analyze the relationship of community axes and endemic and exotic species richness to the environment, and group analysis techniques to identify consistent groupings of species and characterize their properties. We found that community variation could be explained by a two-axis ordination. One axis ranged from conifer forest to grassland and was strongly related to precipitation. The second axis ranged from chaparral to grassland and had little relationship to current environmental conditions, suggesting a possible role for successional history. Precipitation and elevation were respectively the largest influences on endemic and exotic richness, followed by Mg2+/ Ca2+. The results also support the idea that long-term precipitation patterns have altered the Mg2+/ Ca2+ ratio via selective leaching, resulting in indirect influences on endemics ( positive) and exotics ( negative) but not affecting the abundances of common species. We discuss implications of these findings for the conservation of the California serpentine flora.},

abstract = {At landscape and regional scales topography is recognized as one of the most important determinants of vascular plant diversity, primarily due to the infl uence of mountains. As temperature changes markedly over the elevation ranges in mountain areas, topography off ers a wide variety of diff erent habitats as well as buff ering against climate change. However, for local vegetation, notably in lowland areas, the general importance of topography is less well recognized and the mecha- nisms by which it exerts infl uence on local vascular plant diversity are not comprehensively understood. In this review, we provide an overview of the evidence for the diff erent mechanisms involved in topography ' s control of local patterns in potential vegetation drivers, namely incident solar energy, wind exposure, hydrology, geochemistry, and biotic conditions. Furthermore, we review the processes through which these factors shape local terrestrial vascular plant diversity patterns and provide directions for future studies on this topic. We fi nd that topography is an important factor for local vascular plant diversity patterns in a broad range of habitats throughout the world, even in relatively fl at lowlands. However, the mechanisms involved are varied and complex. Local patterns in soil moisture seem to be aff ected by topography through more mechanisms than other topographically controlled factors and have a strong and consistent infl uence on local plant diversity. Hence, local hydrology is probably the main mechanistic factor through which topography infl uences local terres- trial vascular plant diversity patterns. Future research should focus on employing high-coverage fi ne-resolution topographic data to comprehensively explore the role of topography in controlling local dynamics over large areas. Moreover, we recom- mend including several diff erent habitats, particularly those in which the role of topography is poorly understood. Finally, we propose to integrate relevant functional topographic variables such as topographic wetness indices instead of simple topographic measures into future investigations.},

abstract = {In order to test hypotheses about changes in the environment induced by man, including climatic change, ecologists are sampling portions of the environment repeatedly across time. This paper describes a method for testing a space-time interaction in repeated ecological survey data, when there is no replication at the level of individual sampling units (sites). This methodological development is important for the analysis of long-term monitoring data, including systems under anthropogenic influence. In these systems, an interaction may indicate that the spatial structure of community composition has changed in the course of time or that the temporal evolution is not the same at all sites. This paper describes ANOVA models corresponding to the steps leading to a solution to the problem, which is based on the representation of space and time by principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM eigenfunctions) in the ANOVA. Numerical simulations showed that ANOVA Model 5 was the model of choice for the analysis of the space-time interaction because it always had correct rates of Type I error, and its power was always equal to or higher than those of other possible models of analysis. If the hypothesis of absence of interaction is not rejected, one cannot conclude that a change has occurred in the spatial structure of the response data across time; one should follow the ordinary rules of two-way ANOVA if testing the significance of the main factors is of interest. If the hypothesis of absence of interaction is rejected, one should model the spatial structure of each time period in a separate way. One can also conduct a single test involving a separate model of the spatial structure for each time period. This paper presents two applications to real ecological data.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Statistical tests partitioning community variation into environmental and spatial components have been widely used to test ecological theories and explore the determinants of community structure for applied conservation questions. Despite the wide use of these tests, there is considerable debate about their relative effectiveness. 2. We used simulated communities to evaluate the most commonly employed tests that partition community variation: regression on distance matrices and canonical ordination using a third-order polynomial, principal components of neighbour matrices (PCNM) or Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) to model spatial components. Each test was evaluated under a variety of realistic sampling scenarios. 3. All tests failed to correctly model spatial and environmental components of variation, and in some cases produced biased estimates of the relative importance of components. Regression on distance matrices under-fit the spatial component, and ordination models consistently under-fit the environmental component. The PCNM and MEM approaches often produced inflated R2 statistics, apparently as a result of statistical artefacts involving selection of superfluous axes. This problem occurred regardless of the forward-selection technique used. 4. Both sample configuration and the underlying linear model used to analyse species-environment relationships also revealed strong potential to bias results. 5. Synthesis and applications. Several common applications of variation partitioning in ecology now appear inappropriate. These potentially include decisions for community conservation based on inferred relative strengths of niche and dispersal processes, inferred community responses to climate change, and numerous additional analyses that depend on precise results from multivariate variation-partitioning techniques. We clarify the appropriate uses of these analyses in research programmes, and outline potential steps to improve them.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

abstract = {Both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation influence the compositional structure of forest communities, but previous studies examining the relative contributions of these processes with variation partitioning have primarily used topography to represent the influence of the environment. Here, we bring together data on both topography and soil resource variation within eight large (24-50 ha) tropical forest plots, and use variation partitioning to decompose community compositional variation into fractions explained by spatial, soil resource and topographic variables. Both soil resources and topography account for significant and approximately equal variation in tree community composition (9-34{\%} and 5-29{\%}, respectively), and all environmental variables together explain 13-39{\%} of compositional variation within a plot. A large fraction of variation (19-37{\%}) was spatially structured, yet unexplained by the environment, suggesting an important role for dispersal processes and unmeasured environmental variables. For the majority of sites, adding soil resource variables to topography nearly doubled the inferred role of habitat filtering, accounting for variation in compositional structure that would previously have been attributable to dispersal. Our results, illustrated using a new graphical depiction of community structure within these plots, demonstrate the importance of small-scale environmental variation in shaping local community structure in diverse tropical forests around the globe.},

@article{Marquez2013,
abstract = {Controversy on whether local (deterministic) or regional (stochastic) factors control the structure of communities persists after decades of research. The main reason for why it has not been resolved may lie in the nature of evidence which largely comes from realized natural communities. In such communities assembly history leaves a mark that may support either set of factors. To avoid the confounding effects of assembly history we controlled for these effects experimentally. We created a null community by mixing 17 rock pool communities. We then divided the null community into replicates and distributed among treatments representing a gradient of factors from local to regional. We hypothesized that if deterministic factors dominate the assembly of communities, community structures should show a corresponding gradient from being very similar and convergent to dissimilar and divergent. In contrast, if local processes are predominantly stochastic in nature, such a gradient of community configurations should emerge even in the homogeneous setting. Our results appear to partially support both hypotheses and thus suggest that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of communities. Furthermore, we found that to satisfactorily explain patterns observed in natural communities environmental heterogeneity and regional processes must also be considered. In conclusion, although deterministic mechanisms seem to be important in the assembly of communities, in natural systems their signal may be diluted and masked whenever other factors exert meaningful influence. Such factors increase the number of possible paths to the point that the number of paths equals the number of communities in a metacommunity.},

abstract = {We evaluated the roles of the abiotic environment and dispersal in the assembly of fern communities at contrasting spatial scales within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest. Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135-3515 m (mesoscale) or 4-134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted. in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors. This outcome supports the relevance of developing theory that considers the joint effects of environmental determinism and dispersal on the distribution and abundance of plant species.},

abstract = {1.Ecological studies often rely on coefficients of intercommunity (dis)similarity to decipher effects of ecological, evolutionary, human-driven mechanisms on the composition of communities. Yet, two main criticisms have been leveled at (dis)similarity coefficients. First, few developments include information on species' abundances, and either phylogeny or functional traits. Second, some (dis)similarity coefficients fail to always provide maximum dissimilarity between two completely distinct communities, i.e. communities without common species and with zero similarities among their species. 2.Here, we introduce a new family of similarity coefficients responding to these criticisms. Within this family, we concentrate on four coefficients and compare them to Rao's dissimilarity on macroinvertebrate communities, and simulated data. 3.Our new coefficients correctly treat maximally dissimilar communities: similarities are always zero between two completely distinct communities. The originality of these new coefficients is even more profound as the existence of maximally dissimilar communities was not a requirement for the new coefficients to behave differently than Rao's dissimilarity coefficient. 4.Our new family of similarity coefficients relies on the abundances or occurrences of species within communities and on phylogenetic, taxonomic, or functional similarities among species. We demonstrate that this new family embeds many of the recent developments in both functional and phylogenetic diversity. It provides a unique framework for comparing traditional compositional turnover with functional or phylogenetic similarities among communities. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Different assembly processes may simultaneously affect local-scale variation of species composition in temperate old-growth forests. Ground layer species diversity reflects chance colonization and persistence of low-dispersal species, as well as fine-scale environmental heterogeneity. The latter depends on both purely abiotic factors, such as soil properties and topography, and factors primarily determined by overstorey structure, such as light availability. Understanding the degree to which plant diversity in old-growth forests is associated with structural heterogeneity and/or to dispersal limitation will help assessing the effectiveness of silvicultural practices that recreate old-growth patterns and structures for the conservation or restoration of plant diversity. We used a nested sampling design to assess fine-scale species turnover, i.e. the proportion of species composition that changes among sampling units, across 11 beech-dominated old-growth forests in Southern Europe. For each stand, we also measured a wide range of environmental and structural variables that might explain ground layer species turnover. Our aim was to quantify the relative importance of dispersal limitation in comparison to that of stand structural heterogeneity while controlling for other sources of environmental heterogeneity. For this purpose, we used multiple regression on distance matrices at the within-stand extent, and mixed effect models at the extent of the whole dataset. Species turnover was best predicted by structural and environmental heterogeneity, especially by differences in light availability and in topsoil nutrient concentration and texture. Spatial distances were significant only in four out of eleven stands with a relatively low explanatory power. This suggests that structural heterogeneity is a more important driver of local-scale ground layer species turnover than dispersal limitation in southern European old-growth beech forests.},

abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

abstract = {Despite widespread acknowledgement that local ecological communities are profoundly shaped by regional-scale influences, including evolutionary and biogeographic processes, this perspective has yet to be widely incorporated into ecological research. Drawing on recent research, we propose four steps towards making regional influences a stronger part of research on the richness of local communities: (1) identifying the regional-scale causes of variation in species richness in the systems ecologists study; (2) testing for effects of regional richness on local richness, using improved observational and experimental analyses to overcome earlier problems; (3) simultaneously analysing environmental influences on regional and local species richness as well as the influence of regional richness on local richness and (4) considering the potential reciprocal effects of local processes on regional richness. In conclusion, we suggest some ways that similar approaches could be applied to other aspects of community structure beyond species richness.},

abstract = {The spatial arrangement of tree species is a key aspect of community ecology. Because tree species in tropical forests occur at low densities, it is logistically challenging to measure distributions across large areas. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of canopy tree crown maps, derived from high-resolution aerial digital photographs, as a relatively simple method for measuring large-scale tree distributions. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used high-resolution aerial digital photographs ({\~{}}0.129 m/pixel) to identify tree species and map crown distributions of four target tree species. We determined crown mapping accuracy by comparing aerial and ground-mapped distributions and tested whether the spatial characteristics of the crown maps reflect those of the ground-mapped trees. Nearly a quarter (22{\%}) of the common canopy species had sufficiently distinctive crowns to be good candidates for reliable mapping. The errors of commission (crowns misidentified as a target species) were relatively low, but the errors of omission (missed canopy trees of the target species) were high. Only 40 percent of canopy individuals were mapped on the air photographs. Despite failing to accurately predict exact abundances of canopy trees, crown distributions accurately reproduced the clumping patterns and spatial autocorrelation features of three of four tree species and predicted areas of high and low abundance. We discuss a range of ecological and forest management applications for which this method can be useful. Un aspecto clave en ecolog{\'{i}}a de comunidades es la distribuci{\'{o}}n espacial de especies de arboles. Sin embargo, debido a que estas especies se encuentran en bajas densidad en los bosques tropicales, es log{\'{i}}sticamente exigente medir su distribuci{\'{o}}n en grandes {\'{a}}reas.

abstract = {We investigated relationships between richness patterns of rare and common grassland species and environmental factors, focussing on comparing the degree to which the richness patterns of rare and common species are determined by simple environmental variables. Using data collected in the Machair grassland of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, we fitted spatial regression models using a suite of grazing, soil physicochemical and microtopographic covariates, to nested sub- assemblages of vascular and non-vascular species ranked according to rarity. As expected, we found that common species drive richness patterns, but rare vascular species had significantly stronger affinity for high richness areas. After correcting for the prevalence of individual species distributions, we found differences between common and rare species in 1) the amount of variation explained: richness patterns of common species were better summarised by simple environmental variables, 2) the associations of environmental variables with richness showed systematic trends between common and rare species with coefficient sign reversal for several factors, and 3) richness associations with rare environments: richness patterns of rare vascular species significantly matched rare environments but those of non-vascular species did not. Richness patterns of rare species, at least in this system, may be intrinsically less predictable than those of common species.},

abstract = {The processes controlling the abundances of species across multiple sites form the cornerstone of modern ecology. In these metacommunities, the relative importance of local environmental and regional spatial processes is currently hotly debated, especially in terms of the validity of neutral model. I collected 158 published data sets with information on community structure, environmental and spatial variables. I showed that approximately 50{\%} of the variation in community composition is explained by both environmental and spatial variables. The majority of the data sets were structured by species-sorting dynamics (SS), followed by a combination of SS and mass-effect dynamics. While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8{\%} of the collected natural communities, disregarding neutral dispersal processes would result in missing important patterns in 37{\%} of the studied communities. Moreover, metacommunity characteristics such as dispersal type, habitat type and spatial scale predicted part of the detected variation in metacommunity structure.},

abstract = {Issues of scale have become increasingly important to ecologists. This book addresses the structure of regional (large-scale) ecological assemblages or communities, and the influence this has at a local (small-scale) level. This macroecological perspective is essential for the broader study of ecology because the structure and function of local communities cannot be properly understood without reference to the region in which they are situated.The book reviews and synthesizes the issues of current importance in macroecology, providing a balanced summary of the field that will be useful for biologists at advanced undergraduate level and above. These general issues are illustrated by frequent reference to specific well-studied local and regional assemblages -- an approach that serves to relate the macroecological perspective (which is perhaps often difficult to comprehend) to the everyday experience of local sites.Macroecology is an expanding and dynamic discipline. The broad aim of the book is to promote an understanding of why it is such an important part of the wider program of research into ecology.Summarises the current macroecological literature. Provides numerous examples of key patterns. Explicitly links local and regional scale processes.

The degree to which variation in the diversity of local communities in the context of metacommunity ecology concurs with these findings has not been rigorously examined to date. It is also unknown if community turnover along environmental and spatial gradients is mostly attributable to common as opposed to rare species. We examined spatial turnover for three categories of species, all, common, and rare, in seven aquatic metacommunities using simple and partial Mantel tests. We found that variation in turnover along environmental and spatial gradients was generally similar among all, common, and rare species categories, with five of the seven data sets following this pattern. Our findings thus suggest that spatial turnover in aquatic metacommunities can often be adequately described using common species. More importantly, our findings also suggest that turnoverenvironment relationships can also be described relatively well using information from common species only.},

abstract = {Emergence of the metacommunity concept has made a substantial contribution to better understanding of the community composition and dynamics in a regional context. However, long-term field data for testing of available metacommunity models are still scarce, and the extent to which these models apply to the real world remains unknown. Tests conducted so far have largely sought to fit data on the entire regional set of species to one of several metacommunity models, implicitly assuming that all species operate similarly over the same set of sites. However, species differ in their habitat use. These differences can, in the most general terms, be expressed as a gradient of habitat specialization (ranging from habitat specialists to habitat generalists). We postulate that such differences in habitat specialization will have implications for metacommunity dynamics. Specifically, we predict that specialists respond more to local processes and generalists respond to regional spatial processes. We tested these predictions using natural microcosm communities for which long-term (nine-year) environmental and population dynamics data were available. We used redundancy analysis to determine the proportion of variation explained by environmental and spatial factors. We repeated this analysis to explain variation in the entire regional set of species, in generalist species only, and in specialists only. We further used ANOVA to test for differences in the proportions of explained variation. We found that habitat specialists responded primarily to environmental factors and habitat generalists responded mainly to spatial factors. Thus, from the metacommunity perspective, the dynamics of habitat specialists are best explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effects, while that of habitat generalists are best explained by patch dynamics and neutral models. Consequently, we infer that a natural metacommunity can exhibit complicated dynamics, with some groups of species (e.g., habitat specialists) governed according to environmental processes and other groups (e.g., habitat generalists) governed mainly by dispersal processes.},

abstract = {Aim We evaluate characteristics of species ranges (i.e. coherence, species turnover and range boundary clumping) to determine the structure of bat metacommunities and metaensembles from Caribbean islands. We evaluate the effects of endemic species on that structure, and quantify associations between island characteristics and latent environmental gradients that structure these metacommunities and metaensembles.Location Sixty-five Caribbean islands throughout the Bahamas, Greater Antilles and Lesser Antilles.Methods Metacommunity structure is an emergent property of a set of ecological communities at different sites defined by species distributions across geographic or environmental gradients. We analysed elements of metacommunity structure (coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping) to determine the best-fit pattern for metacommunities from all Caribbean islands, as well as from the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles separately. For each island group, analyses were conducted for all bats and for each of two broadly defined guilds (i.e. carnivores and herbivores). In addition, analyses were conducted for all species and for a subset in which endemic species were removed from the fauna. Spearman rank correlations identified island characteristics (area, elevation, latitude, longitude) that were associated significantly with island scores for ordination axes based on reciprocal averaging.Results Metacommunity structure for all bats and for carnivores was similar for each island group, with Clementsian distributions (i.e. discrete communities with groups of species replacing other groups of species along the gradient) for all islands, the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles, but with nested distributions for the Greater Antilles. Herbivore distributions were random for the Bahamas, but were Clementsian for all other island groups. Removal of endemic species affected the best-fit model of metacommunity structure in only 3 of 12 cases. In general, ordination scores for islands were correlated with longitude or latitude, but not with island area or elevation.Main conclusions Characteristics of bat species ranges and associated metacommunity structure were primarily dependent on the number and geographic arrangement of primary sources of colonization, and not on interspecific interactions, species-specific levels of environmental tolerance, or the physical characteristics of islands. Endemic species did not greatly affect metacommunity structure in Caribbean bats.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long investigated why communities are composed of a few common species and many rare species. Most studies relate rarity to either niche differentiation among species or spatial processes. There is a parallel between these processes and the processes proposed to explain the structure of metacommunities. Based on a metacommunity perspective and on data on stream macroinvertebrates from different regions of Brazil, we answer two questions. 1) Are sets of common and rare species affected by similar niche and spatial processes? 2) How does the community composition of common and of rare species differ? The main hypothesis we test is that common species are mainly affected by environmental factors, whereas rare species are mostly influenced by dispersal limitation. We used variation partitioning to determine the proportion of variation explained by the environment and space in common and rare species matrices. Contrary to our expectations, evidence supported the idea that both common and rare species are affected mainly by environmental factors, even after controlling for the differing information content between common and rare species matrices. Moreover, the abundance of some common species is also a good predictor of variation in rare species matrices. Niche differences are unlikely to be the sole cause of patterns of rarity in these metacommunities. We suggest that sets of common and rare species react to similar major environmental gradients and that rare species also respond to processes that operate at a more fine-grained spatial scale, particularly biotic interactions. We extend the view that species sorting is the dominant process structuring metacommunities and argue that future studies focusing on rarity would benefit from a metacommunity perspective},

abstract = {Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence-absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence-absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

abstract = {Clifford, Richardson, and Hemon (1989, Biometrics 45, 123-134) presented modified tests of association between two spatially autocorrelated processes, for lattice and non-lattice data. These tests are built on the sample covariance and on the sample correlation coefficient; they require the estimation of an effective sample size that takes into account the spatial structure of both processes. Clifford et al. developed their method on the basis of an approximation of the variance of the sample correlation coefficient and assessed it by Monte Carlo simulations for lattice and non-lattice networks of moderate to large size. In the present paper, the variance of the sample covariance is computed for a finite number of locations, under the multinormality assumption, and the mathematical derivation of the definition of effective sample size is given. The theoretically expected number of degrees of freedom for the modified t test with renewed modifications is compared with that computed on the basis of equation (2.9) of Clifford et al. (1989). The largest differences are observed for small numbers of locations and high autocorrelation, in particular when the latter is present with opposite sign in the two processes. Basic references that were missing in Clifford et al. (1989) are given and inherent ambiguities are discussed},

Rather than being dominated by rural farmers, tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries and economic globalization, with timber operations, oil and gas development, large-scale farming and exotic-tree plantations being the most frequent causes of forest loss. Although instigating serious challenges, such changes are also creating important new opportunities for forest conservation. Here we argue that, by increasingly targeting strategic corporations and trade groups with public-pressure campaigns, conservation interests could have a much stronger influence on the fate of tropical forests.},

abstract = {Abstract. Ecological studies often require studying the common structure of a pair of data tables. Co-inertia analysis is a multivariate method for coupling two tables. It is often neglected by ecologists who prefer the widely used methods of redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. We present the co-inertia criterion for measuring the adequacy between two data sets. Co-inertia analysis is based on this criterion as are ca- nonical correspondence analysis or canonical correlation analysis, but the latter two have additional constraints. Co-inertia analysis is very flexible and allows many possibilities for coupling. Co-inertia analysis is suitable for quantitative and/or qualitative or fuzzy envi- ronmental variables. Moreover, various weighting of sites and various transformations and/ or centering of species data are available for this method. Hence, more ecological consid- erations can be taken into account in the statistical procedures. Moreover, the principle of this method is very general and can be easily extended to the case of distance matrices or to the case of more than two tables. Simulated ecological data are used to compare the co- inertia approach with other available methods},

abstract = {Question: Are there spatial structures in the composition of plant communities? Methods: Identification and measurement of spatial structures is a topic of great interest in plant ecology. Univariate measurements of spatial autocorrelation such as Moran's I and Geary's c are widely used, but extensions to the multivariate case (i.e. multi-species) are rare. Here, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran's I (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This analysis, which is a generalization of Wartenberg's approach to multivariate spatial correlation, would imply a compromise between the relations among many variables (multivariate analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation). MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle various kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency tables). A study is presented to illustrate the method using a spatial version of Correspondence Analysis. Location: Territoire d'Etude et d'Exp{\'{e}}rimentation de Trois-Fontaines (eastern France). Results: Ordination of vegetation plots by this spatial analysis is quite robust with reference to rare species and highlights spatial patterns related to soil properties.},

We compared the dispersal morphologies, fruit sizes, and spatial distributions of 561 tree species within a fully mapped, 50-hectare plot of primary tropical forest in peninsular Malaysia. We demonstrate here that the extent and scale of conspecific spatial aggregation is correlated with the mode of seed dispersal. This relationship holds for saplings as well as for mature trees. Phylogenetically independent contrasts confirm that the relationship between dispersal and spatial pattern is significant even after controlling for common ancestry among species. We found the same qualitative results for a 50-hectare tropical forest plot in Panama. Our results provide broad empirical evidence for the importance of dispersal mode in establishing the long-term community structure of tropical forests.},

Significant changes in the structure and composition of seemingly undisturbed Wisconsin forest communities have occurred over the past 50 years, including widespread declines in alpha and beta species diversity. To investigate how shifts in species composition have affected distributions of plant functional traits, we first compiled extensive data on understory plant species traits. We then computed community-weighted trait means and functional diversity metrics for communities in both the 1950s and 2000s. We examined how trait values and diversity varied across environmental gradients and among Wisconsin's four main ecoregions. Trait means and diversity values reflect conspicuous gradients in species composition, soils, and climatic conditions. Over the past 50 years, values of most traits have changed as communities shifted toward species with higher le...},

abstract = {Vegetation ordination is usually based on classical data reduction techniques such as principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, or multidimensional scaling. The usual methods do not account for multiscale correlations among species. In this paper, we use a geostatistical method, known as multivariate factorial kriging, for studying multiple-scale correlations. The case study was carried out in a mixed broadleaf forest of central Spain. Six tree species were included in the analysis. Data analysis included (i) experimental variogram calculation and modeling with the use of the linear model of coregionalization, (ii) principal components analysis, and (iii) cokriging. The results indicate that correlations among species are different depending on the spatial scale. We conclude that competition for light is the main factor controlling the spatial distribution of species at the plot-level scale of variation. At larger scales of variation, soil conditions and (or) human intervention are the key factors in determining the observed vegetation pattern. Based on the factor scores for the largest scale of variation, we conducted a cluster analysis to identify plots with similar characteristics. The resulting clusters have the remarkable property of being spatially continuous.},

However, it has not been adequately investigated by ecologists or philosophers of ecology. In the contemporary philosophy of ecology we can recognize a kind of implicit consensus about this issue: while the etiological approaches cannot offer a good concept of function in ecology, Cummins' systemic approach can. Here we propose to go beyond this implicit consensus, because we think these approaches are not adequate for ecology. We argue that a sound epistemological framework to function in ecology is to be found in organizational approaches. In this line, we define function in ecology as a precise effect of a given constraint on the ecosystem flow of matter and energy performed by a given item of biodiversity, within a closure of constraints. We elaborate on this definition by developing a case study of a bromeliad ecosystem.},

@article{Tirado2005,
abstract = {Spatial patterns in plant communities are thought to be controlled by the interplay of species interactions and environmental constraints. To evaluate the role of plant/plant interactions in shaping these communities we quantified species co-occurrence and interaction in seven environmentally distinct communities. These included four different semiarid habitats in southeast Spain, one alpine system in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain), and two sites in Venezuela, a secondary savanna near Caracas (Altos de Pipe), and a sclerophyllous shrubland in the Gran Sabana plateau. We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects. Facilitation appears as a relevant process shaping communities under environmental constraints.},

@article{Buckley2010,
abstract = {Biologists have long searched for mechanisms responsible for the increase in species richness with decreasing latitude. The strong correlation between species richness and climate is frequently interpreted as reflecting a causal link via processes linked to energy or evolutionary rates. Here, we investigate how the aggregation of clades, as dictated by phylogeny, can give rise to significant climate-richness gradients without gradients in diversification or environmental carrying capacity. The relationship between climate and species richness varies considerably between clades, regions and time periods in a global-scale phylogenetically informed analysis of all terrestrial mammal species. Many young clades show negative richness-temperature slopes (more species at cooler temperatures), with the ages of these clades coinciding with the expansion of temperate climate zones in the late Eocene. In carnivores, we find steeply positive richness-temperature slopes in clades with restricted distributions and tropical origins (e.g. cat clade), whereas widespread, temperate clades exhibit shallow, negative slopes (e.g. dog-bear clade). We show that the slope of the global climate-richness gradient in mammals is driven by aggregating Chiroptera (bats) with their Eutherian sister group. Our findings indicate that the evolutionary history should be accounted for as part of any search for causal links between environment and species richness.},

@article{Pulliam2000,
abstract = {Applications of Hutchinson's n-dimensional niche concept are often focused on the role of interspecific competition in shaping species distribution patterns. In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions},

abstract = {Synthesis of ecological and evolutionary concepts and tools has led to improved understanding of how diversification, dis- persal, community assembly, long-term coexistence and extinction shape patterns of biological diversity. Phylogeography, with its focus on Quaternary interactions within and between populations, can help elucidate the processes acting between the evolutionary time-scales on which species arise and the ecological time-scales on which members of an assemblage inter- act with each other and their environment. Still, it has yet to be widely incorporated in that synthesis. Here, we highlight three areas where integration of phylogeography with ecological and evolutionary approaches can provide new insights into key questions. First, phylogeography can help clarify the roles of isolation, niche conservatism and environmental stabil- ity in generating patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity. Second, phylogeography can help isolate the effects of Quaternary dispersal limitation from other factors driving community assembly and spatial turnover. Third, phylogeography can help identify key processes leading to and resulting from extinction events, including the population dynamics of species range reduction and its effects on the strength and temporal flexibility of networks of species interactions. We conclude with an outlook on the data-gathering protocols necessary for this collaborative, interdisciplinary research agenda.},

abstract = {Large tree species have a disproportional influence on the structure and functioning of tropical forests, but the forces affecting their long-term persistence in human-dominated landscapes remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that aging forest edges and small fragments (3.4-295.7 ha) are greatly impoverished in terms of species richness and abundance of large trees in comparison to core areas of forest interior. The study was conducted in a hyper-fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest, northeast Brazil. Large tree species were quantified by recording all trees (DBH ??? 10 cm) within fifty-eight 0.1-ha plots distributed in three forest habitats: small forest fragments (n = 28), forest edges (n = 10), and primary forest interior areas within an exceptional large forest remnant (n = 20). Large tree species and their stems ???10 cm DBH were reduced by half in forest edges and fragments. Moreover, these edge-affected habitats almost lacked large-stemmed trees altogether (0.24 ?? 0.27{\%} of all stems sampled), and very tall trees were completely absent from forest edges. In contrast, large trees contributed to over 1.5{\%} of the whole stand in forest interior plots (2.9 ?? 2.8{\%}). Habitats also differed in terms of tree architecture: relative to their DBH trees were on average 30{\%} shorter in small fragments and forest edges. Finally, an indicator species analysis yielded an ecological group of 12 large tree species that were significantly associated with forest interior plots, but were completely missing from edge-affected habitats. Our results suggest a persistent and substantial impoverishment of the large-tree stand, including the structural collapse of forest emergent layer, in aging, hyper-fragmented landscapes. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There are many books on regression and analysis of variance. These books expect different levels of preparedness and place different emphases on the material. This book is not introductory. It presumes some knowledge of basic statistical theory and practice. Students are expected to know the essentials of statistical inference like estimation, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. A basic knowledge of data analysis is presumed. Some linear algebra and calculus is also required. The emphasis of this text is on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. The objective is to learn what methods are available and more importantly, when they should be applied. Many examples are presented to clarify the use of the techniques and to demonstrate what conclusions can be made. There is relatively less emphasis on mathematical theory, partly because some prior knowledge is assumed and partly because the issues are better tackled elsewhere. Theory is important because it guides the approach we take. I take a wider view of statistical theory. It is not just the formal theorems. Qualitative statistical concepts are just as important in Statistics because these enable us to actually do it rather than just talk about it. These qualitative principles are harder to learn because they are difficult to state precisely but they guide the successful experienced Statistician. Data analysis cannot be learnt without actually doing it. This means using a statistical computing package. There is a wide choice of such packages. They are designed for different audiences and have different strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use R (ref. Ihaka and Gentleman (1996)). Why do I use R The are several reasons. 1. Versatility. R is a also a programming language, so I am not limited by the procedures that are preprogrammed by a package. It is relatively easy to program new methods in R . 2. Interactivity. Data analysis is inherently interactive. Some older statistical packages were designed when computing was more expensive and batch processing of computations was the norm. Despite improvements in hardware, the old batch processing paradigm lives on in their use. R does one thing at a time, allowing us to make changes on the basis of what we see during the analysis. 3. R is based on S from which the commercial package S-plus is derived. R itself is open-source software and may be freely redistributed. Linux, Macintosh, Windows and other UNIX versions are maintained and can be obtained from the R-project at www.r-project.org. R is mostly compatible with S-plus meaning that S-plus could easily be used for the examples given in this book. 4. Popularity. SAS is the most common statistics package in general but R or S is most popular with researchers in Statistics. A look at common Statistical journals confirms this popularity. R is also popular for quantitative applications in Finance. The greatest disadvantage of R is that it is not so easy to learn. Some investment of effort is required before productivity gains will be realized. This book is not an introduction to R. There is a short introduction in the Appendix but readers are referred to the R-project web site at www.r-project.org where you can find introductory documentation and information about books on R . I have intentionally included in the text all the commands used to produce the output seen in this book. This means that you can reproduce these analyses and experiment with changes and variations before fully understanding R . The reader may choose to start working through this text before learning R and pick it up as you go. The web site for this book is at where data de- scribed in this book appears. Updates will appear there also. Thanks to the builders of R without whom this book would not have been possible.},

abstract = {The literature regarding the diversity of ectoparasites and their interaction with their hosts remains largely inadequate in Malaysian tropical rainforest. We investigate the interaction patterns and specialization of ectoparasites infesting terrestrial small mammals (rodents and scandents) in Peninsular and Malaysian Borneo from samples made in 16 localities between 2008 and 2010. A total of 3,235 individuals of ectoparasites were collected during field surveys, resulting in an interaction network involving 47 ectoparasites that were distributed on 23 species of small mammals. The overall specialization index H2? of all ectoparasites and host species was 0.67 which was considered moderate. Ticks appeared to be generalist with specialization index (H2? = 0.35) while lice showed higher specialization (H2? = 1) in selecting host species. The most diverse parasite assemblage was found on S. muelleri (Hs{\_}w = 1.96). Specialization indices among ectoparasite species (dp) ranged from 0.03 to 1 while the indices among host species (dh) ranged from 0.20 to 1. Incomplete field data may have contributed to the high specialization indices. This study is significant as it can enhance our understanding the emergence and management of potential zoonotic diseases in Malaysia.},

abstract = {Studies of biodiversity typically assume that all species are equivalent. However, some species in a community maintain viable populations in the study area, while others occur only occasionally as transient individuals. Here we show that North American bird communities can reliably be divided into core and transient species groups and that the richness of each group is driven by different processes. The richness of core species is influenced primarily by local environmental conditions, while the richness of transient species is influenced primarily by the heterogeneity of the surrounding landscape. This demonstrates that the well-known effects of the local environment and landscape heterogeneity on overall species richness are the result of two sets of processes operating differentially on core and transient species. Models of species richness should focus on explaining two distinct patterns, those of core and transient species, rather than a single pattern for the community as a whole.},

@article{Damasceno2014,
abstract = {Accumulating evidence on ecogeographic variation in the mega-diverse central corridor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest motivates us to revisit the vanishing refuge model (VRM) of speciation by Vanzolini and Williams (1981), testing hypotheses on mechanisms of tropical divergence. The VRM reconciles ecogeographic speciation with a modification of the forest refuge model in an attempt to explain patterns of distribution where sister or closely related species inhabit contrasting habitat types. The model evokes vicariance and divergent selection, leading to genetic divergence and phenotypic disparity among populations, eventually leading to speciation caused by climate-driven fragmentation of forested areas that vanish and give place to drier and more open habitats. Thirty years after its publication, this model remains relevant for integrating both geographic and ecological mechanisms of divergence and speciation, and it can be straightforwardly transferred to species in other vanishing biomes. The VRM is faithful to the tone of the earliest discussions about speciation being a multifarious process, yet it is in accordance with most recent studies that emphasize the ecological aspects of divergence. Here we refine the VRM and use examples of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest herpetofauna, spanning across a range of phylogenetic depths, to (1) make clear predictions on patterns of genetic structure, phylogenetic relationships, habitat and climate histories, and phenotypic disparity resulting from this model, and (2) consider alternative hypotheses on drivers of divergence and speciation that result in diversity patterns similar to those expected under the VRM. We also discuss how additional phenotypic and molecular data may help to elucidate mechanisms of divergence. We provide several examples of the Atlantic Forest herpetofauna, illustrating distinct stages of the VRM. Some Atlantic Forest reptiles show two patterns that are expected under the VRM, representing different stages during the process of lineage divergence and speciation. First, sister taxa split between forests and open formations, as predicted when the speciation process is completed under the VRM. Second, as expected during the divergence process, geographically isolated populations inhabiting high elevation forest enclaves surrounded by contrasting habitats (the “brejos de altitude”) are deeply genetically divergent and phenotypically distinct from forest populations in the climatically stable coastal forested areas. Yet, the pattern is not ubiquitous. Some taxa will be more likely than others to diversify in response to the shrinking and vanishing refugia, especially those with the ability to respond quickly to changes in climate and habitat structure. In this context, we predict that additionally to the presence of pre-adaptations, divergent selection is aided by high lability in tolerance traits, in such taxa. The patterns of distribution and phenotypic variation predicted by the VRM, however, are also compatible with alternative scenarios of speciation, including founder events and divergence along an ecological gradient. Our findings support the view that divergent selection acting in populations from geographic isolates in climatically dynamic areas can be a powerful force driving population divergence and, potentially, speciation. This mechanism, we argue, may be important in other vanishing habitats – going beyond forest fragmentation. Our results also highlight how populations in peripheral isolates show potential to adapt locally. We conclude by suggesting that studies on population divergence and speciation will benefit from more integrated analyses of molecular and phenotypic divergence.},

abstract = {1. Attempts to infer underlying ecological process from observed patterns in ecology have been widespread, but have generally relied on first-order (non-spatial) community characteristics such as the species abundance distribution (SAD). This measure has become an important test of several theories of species coexistence, but has proved unsuccessful in distinguishing between them. 2. Spatially explicit data are increasingly available for a range of ecological communities, and analysis methods for these data are well developed. However, relatively little work has investigated the potential of these data for similar inference about mechanisms of coexistence. 3. In this study, we systematically investigate the spatial and non-spatial signals of simulated ecological processes. We include neutral, niche, lottery, Janzen–Connell and heteromyopia models, deriving and comparing first- and second-order measures for the patterns they generate. 4. We find that the SAD is unable to distinguish reliably between underlying models, with random variation in its shape concealing any systematic differences. 5. A new second-order summary measure of spatial structure derived in this paper, in contrast, proves highly sensitive to the type of ecological interaction being modelled, and is robust to random variation. 6.Synthesis. A simple summary measure of the spatial structure of plant communities is presented and found to be a more powerful indicator of underlying process in simulated data than a widely used first-order measure, the SAD. The potential for answering important ecological questions using spatial statistics, particularly concerning mechanisms of coexistence in diverse communities, appears to be great.},

abstract = {The assessment of species rarity considers local abundance (scarce or abundant population), habitat affinity (stenoecious or euryecious species), and geographic distribu- tion (stenotopic or eurytopic species). When analyzed together these variables classify species into eight categories, from common species to those having small populations, unique habitats, and restricted geographic distribution (form 7), as proposed by Rabinowitz in 1981. Based on these categories, it is possible to calculate the frequency of the different forms of rarity of the species present in a given site. The Brazilian Atlantic rainforest is considered a hotspot of the world biodiversity harboring many endemic species, which have restricted geographic distribution. Our objective was to identify the forms of rarity of tree species and their proportions in the southern portion of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest using Rabinowitz's forms of rarity. All the seven forms of rarity are present in the 846 tree species we analyzed: 46{\%} eurytopic and 54{\%} stenotopic, 73{\%} euryecious and 27{\%} stenoecious, 76{\%} locally abundant and 24{\%} locally scarce species. Eurytopic, euryecious locally abundant species accounted for 41.1{\%}, whereas 58.9{\%} were somehow rare: 4.5{\%} eurytopic, euryecious locally scarce, 0.2{\%} eurytopic, stenoecious locally abundant, 0.1{\%} eurytopic, stenoecious locally scarce, 19.5{\%} stenotopic, euryecious locally abundant, 8.0{\%} stenotopic, euryecious locally scarce, 15.6{\%} stenotopic, stenoecious locally abun- dant, and 11.0{\%} stenotopic, stenoecious locally scarce. Considering that the most restrictive forms of rarity precedes extinction, the application of Rabinowitz's system demonstrated that most tree species of the southern Brazilian Atlantic rainforest are threatened due to their restricted geographic distribution, restriction to a single habitat, reduced local abundance, or even to a combination of these variables.},

abstract = {There is a lack of understanding on factors influencing the occurrence of high species heterogeneity at fine scale in the Brazilian cerrado. Soil is a major determinant of vegetation in the Brazilian cerrado and an important candidate to influence species distribution at fine scales, since soil features vary at very small distances, whereas many environmental variables are relatively homogeneous at such scale. We tested plant-soil relationships at fine scales in a cerrado site. We placed 100 contiguous 25m2 plots, where we identified all woody individuals and measured several soil features. We did partial redundancy analysis, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, to test for relationships between soil features and floristic composition. We also did multiple regressions or spatial autoregressive models to test for relationships between soil features and: (1) the abundance of the five most common species, (2) total abundance, (3) richness, (4) evenness, and (5) diversity. We found weak relationships between soil and floristic composition, richness, and total abundance, which, coupled with also weak relationship found in another study with plant available water, indicate there is no major environmental variable influencing vegetation at fine scales, but several of them interacting. Organic matter was positively related with the abundance of Myrsine umbellata and was negatively related to evenness. Although a causal relationship cannot be inferred with certainty, the dominance of Myrsine umbellata seems to be related to a positive feedback with soil. ?? 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {In this review, we highlight the main biotic and abiotic factors that influence the patterns of Neotropical secondary forest successions, referred as the woody vegetation that regrows after complete forest clearance due to human activities. We focus on both patterns of species replacement and various processes that occur during succession, and suggest that the sequence of processes may be predictable even if species composition is not. We describe forest recovery with respect to old-growth conditions, which we define as the structure, function, and composition of the original forest before conversion, and we examine this recovery process within the context of type and intensity of past land use. The various phases of the recovery process are described in detail: from factors affecting early colonization, changes in light and soil properties, soil-vegetation feedbacks at initial and later successional stages, biomass accumulation, forest productivity, rates of species accumulation, and species composition. The consensus of these analyses is that the regenerative power of Neotropical forest vegetation is high, if propagule sources are close by and land use intensity before abandonment has not been severe. Nevertheless, the recovery of biophysical properties and vegetation is heavily dependent on the interactions between site-specific factors and land use, which makes it extremely difficult to predict successional trajectories in anthropogenic settings. We attempt, throughout this review, to integrate the structural and functional characteristics of secondary succession as a way to enhance our ability both to predict and manage successional forest ecosystems due to their increasing importance as timber sources, providers of environmental services, and templates for restoration purposes. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

abstract = {In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species' life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and 14C from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees.},

We evaluate how well these KBAs are represented in the existing protected areas system, prioritize among them, and analyze critical aspects of the KBA methodology in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest context, such as its ability to guide specific conservation strategies. Building upon an extensive database with 1,636 species records and 122 previously identified Important Bird Areas, we dem- onstrate that conservation assessments in highly fragmented landscapes may be benefited by high resolution species data as is required by the KBA process. We identify 538 KBAs for 141 globally threatened vertebrate species. Prioritizing among these KBA, we highlight the 24 most irreplaceable sites for terrestrial vertebrate species conservation in the Atlantic Forest, based on existing data.},

abstract = {Aim To use parsimony analysis of endemicity and cladistic analysis of distributions and endemism to evaluate two hypotheses addressing biogeographical relationships among Amazonia, the Caatinga forest enclaves, Pernambuco Centre and the southern Atlantic Forest. Location North-eastern Brazil, South America. Methods To find the most parsimonious areagram we analysed a matrix composed of the presence (1) or absence (0) of 745 taxa (i.e. 293 genera and 452 species of woody plants) within 16 localities belonging to the four large regions addressed in this study. Results One most parsimonious areagram was found and it shows a basal separation between the southern Atlantic Forest and all other regions. This break is followed by a separation between all Caatinga forest enclaves (except Baturite´) from a cluster composed of Baturite´, the Pernambuco Centre and Amazonia. In this cluster, the most basal separation isolates Baturite´ from the cluster formed by localities from Amazonia and the Pernambuco Centre. The biogeographical relationships among sites could not be explained by either a random distribution of species among sites or by the geographical distance between sites. Main conclusions We found strong cladistic signal within the raw distribution and phylogenetic data used in our analysis, indicating structured species assemblages in the surveyed localities. They have resulted from the fragmentation of an ancestral biota that was once widely distributed in the region. Our results also support the hypothesis that Atlantic Forest is not a biogeographically natural area, because the Pernambuco Centre is more closely related to Amazonia than to the southern Atlantic Forest. Finally, our data do not support the notion that Caatinga forest enclaves comprise a single biogeographical region, because one Caatinga forest enclave (Baturite´) is much more closely related to the cluster formed by Amazonia and the Pernambuco Centre than to other sites. These relationships suggest the occurrence of forest connections between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forests across Caatinga during several periods of the Tertiary and Quaternary. However, palaeoecological data currently available for the Caatinga region are still scarce and do not have either the spatial or temporal resolution required to reconstruct the history of connections among the forests in north-eastern Brazil.

abstract = {There has been a resurging interest in patterns of $\beta$-diversity, especially by the mechanisms driving broad-scale, continental and global patterns, and how partitioning $\beta$-diversity into richness (or nestedness) and turnover components can be linked with such mechanisms. Here we compared two recent methodologies to find richness and turnover components of $\beta$-diversity, using a large regional scale dataset of mammal, bird, reptiles and amphibian species found in seven regions of Central, North and Northeastern Brazil. As well as a simple comparison of the metrics available, we analyzed spatial patterns (i.e., distance-decay similarity) and the effects of biome type in these components using raw and partial Mantel tests. Our analyses revealed that turnover estimated using Baselga's (2010) approach is slightly higher than the estimate using Carvalho's et al. (2012) approach, but all analyses show consistent spatial patterns in species turnover using both methods. Spatial patterns in $\beta$-diversity revealed by Mantel tests are also consistent with expectations based on differential dispersal abilities. Our results also reinforce that spatial patterns in $\beta$-diversity, mainly in the turnover components expressing faunal differentiation, are determined by a mix or broad scale environmental effects and short distance spatially-structured dispersal.},

abstract = {Long-term environmental changes will likely alter the strengths of interactions between species and consequently their population dynamics, leading to changes in the stability of ecological systems. While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short ({\textless}1–2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host–parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might...},

abstract = {The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its application. In this review, we examine how different sources of variability in population dynamics contribute to coexistence. Unfortunately, few general rules emerge among the different models that have been studied to date. Nonetheless, we believe that a greater understanding is possible, based on the integration of coexistence and population extinction risk theories. There are two conditions for coexistence in the presence of environmental and demographic variability: (1) the average per capita growth rates of all coexisting species must be positive when at low densities, and (2) these growth rates must be strong enough to overcome negative random events potentially pushing densities to extinction. We propose that critical tests for species coexistence must account for niche differentiation arising from this variability and should be based explicitly on notions of stability and ecological drift.},

With the passing of time, this body of work merged with geostatistics to form the present day discipline of spatial statistics. The families of auto- and semivariogram models constitute a prominent component of the subject matter of contemporary spatial statistics. Its expansion from linear to generalized linear statistical models involves new methodologies, one of which is eigenvector spatial filtering. This paper presents evidence that this particular new methodology furnishes an effective dimension reduction substitution for the spatial lag matrix appearing in spatial auto-models. It also summarizes ongoing extensions of this methodology to space-time and spatial interaction data. Eigenvector spatial filtering methodology presents a new frontier for spatial statistical research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {AimsConduct a quantitative, but rapid, regional-level assessment of the alpine flora across northwest Yunnan (NWY) to provide a broad-based understanding of local and regional patterns of the composition, diversity and health of alpine ecosystems across NWY. MethodsA stratified random sampling design was employed to select sites across the different mountain ranges of NWY. Vegetation was sampled by stratifying each site by the three major alpine vegetation community types: meadow, dwarf shrub and scree. Two 50-m transects were randomly located within each community type at each sampling site with 10 1-m2 subplots systematically placed along each transect. Environmental variables were recorded at each transect. Multivariate analyses were used to classify the major plant community assemblages and link community patterns to environmental and habitat variables. Important FindingsForb species richness varied from 19 to 105 species per site (21 sites total) with an average of 59 species per site (60 m2 sampled per site). Most species were patchily distributed with narrow distributions and/or small population sizes; over half the species occurred at only one or two sites. Distinct species assemblages were identified in the meadow vegetation that was strongly aggregated by geographic location suggesting the presence of distinct phytogeographic zones of the meadow alpine flora. Elevation and geographic location were the dominant environmental gradients underlying the variations in species composition. Jaccard's coefficient of similarity averaged only 10{\%} among sites indicating there was little similarity in the alpine flora across the region. The alpine vegetation is highly heterogeneous across the complex landscape of the Hengduan Mountains of NWY. Conservation strategies need to take into account the large geographic differences in the flora to maximize protection of biodiversity.},

Here we address how competition and facilitation vary with seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, and how the effects of these fluctuations change with plant ontogeny. We planted three sizes of pine seedlings (Pinus strobus) into an herbaceous diversity experiment and measured pine growth every two weeks for two growing seasons. Both competition and facilitation occurred at different times of year between pines and their neighbors. Facilitation was important for the smallest pines when environmental conditions were severe. This effect decreased as pines got larger. Competition was stronger than facilitation overall and outweighed facilitative effects at annual time scales. Our data suggest that both competition and the counter-directional effects of facilitation may be more common and more intense than previously considered.},

abstract = {Stones were used to sample macroinvertebrates and characterise microhabitats at monthly or bimonthly intervals in six Ecuadorian streams covering a gradient in four different stability measures and other stream characteristics. The physical variables current velocity, water depth, horizontal position, embeddedness and size were measured to characterise stone microhabitats and presumed to be affected by or related to physical impact during hydrological disturbances. My first objective was to analyse how density, the number of families and a richness measure (residuals from a power regression of families vs. individuals) were related to the physical characteristics of individual stone habitats. My second objective was to quantify temporal variability in fauna–stone relationships and to analyse if such variability was related to overall stability of stream reaches. Partial Least Squares (PLS) multiple regression analyses showed high temporal variability between sampling dates in factor loadings of specific stone micro habitat variables. In spite of this, there was a clear negative effect of depth and a positive effect of current on density and number of families. Stone size was consistently negatively related to density and positively related to number of families. Patterns were less clear for richness residuals. Simple linear regressions of fauna vs. stone para- meters generally confirmed the results reached by the PLS analysis, although few of the regressions were significant. For all fauna–stone regressions the variability in slopes was much higher among sampling dates within streams (temporal variability) than among streams (spatial variability), and significant slopes were even inverted on different sampling dates. Although the coefficients of variation (CV) of slopes of a given combination of fauna parameter and stone variable from different sampling dates (n ¼ 9–11) were rarely correlated to any of the measures of stream stability, this study has demonstrated high temporal variability in fauna–stone relationships (CV's of regression slopes). Consequently, temporally un-replicated studies of such relationships do not necessarily reveal general patterns.},

Species richness was unimodally related to mean soil depth and relative elevation. Microsite heterogeneity and soil depth heterogeneity were positively correlated with species richness, and the richness peaks of the unimodal gradients correspond to the maximally spatially heterogeneous plots. The best predictive models of species richness and evenness, however, showed that other factors, such as ramet density and flooding, are the major determinants of diversity in this system. The findings that soil depth heterogeneity had effects on diversity when the effects of mean soil depth were factored out, and that unimodal richness peaks were associated with high spatial heterogeneity in environmental factors represent significant contributions to our understanding of how spatial heterogeneity might contribute to diversity maintenance in plant communities.},

abstract = {Vegetation and its correlation with environment has been traditionally studied at a single scale of observation. If different ecological processes are dominant at different spatial and temporal scales, the results obtained from such observations will be specific to the single scale of observation employed and will lack generality. Consequently, it is important to assess whether the processes that determine community structure and function are similar at different scales, or whether, how rapidly, and under what circumstances the dominant processes change with scale of observation. Indeed, early work by Greig-Smith and associates (Greig-Smith 1952; Austin {\&} Greig-Smith 1968; see Greig-Smith 1979; Kershaw {\&} Looney 1985; Austin {\&} Nicholls 1988) suggested that plant-plant interactions are typically important at small scales, but that the physical environment dominates at large scales. Using a gridded and mapped 6.6 ha portion of the Duke Forest on the North Carolina piedmont for a case study, we examined the importance of scale in vegetation studies by testing four hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that the correlation between vegetation composition and environment should increase with increasing grain (quadrat) size. Our results support this hypothesis. Second, we hypothesized that the environmental factors most highly correlated with species composition should be similar at all grain sizes within the 6.6-ha study area, and should be among the environmental factors strongly correlated with species composition over the much larger extent of the ca. 3500 ha Duke Forest. Our data are not consistent with either portion of this hypothesis. Third, we hypothesized that at the smaller grain sizes employed in this study (≤ 256 m2), the composition of the tree canopy should contribute significantly to the vegetation pattern in the under-story. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Finally, we predicted that with increased extent of sampling, the correlation between environment and vegetation should increase. Our data suggest the opposite may be true. This study confirms that results of vegetation analyses can depend greatly on the grain and extent of the samples employed. Whenever possible, sampling should include a variety of grain sizes and a carefully selected sample extent so as to ensure that the results obtained are robust. Application of the methods used here to a variety of vegetation types could lead to a better understanding of whether different ecological processes typically dominate at different spatial scales.

abstract = {Macroecological studies infer ecological processes based on observed patterns. An often used measure of pattern is the species-area curve. Insufficient attention has been paid to the variety of methods used to construct those curves. There are six different methods based on different combinations of: (1) the pattern of quadrats or areas sampled (nested, contiguous, noncontiguous, or island); (2) whether successively larger areas are constructed in a spatially explicit fashion or not; and (3) whether the curve is constructed from single values or mean values. The resulting six types of curves differ in their shapes, how diversity is encapsulated, and the scales encompassed. Inventory diversity ($\alpha$) can either represent a single value or a mean value, creating a difference in the focus of the measure. Differentiation diversity ($\beta$) can vary in the extent encompassed, and thus the spatial scale, depending on the pattern of quadrat placement. Species-area curves are used for a variety of purposes: extrapolation, setting a common grain, and hypothesis testing. The six types of curves differ in how they are used or interpreted in these contexts. A failure to recognize these differences can result in improper conclusions. Further work is needed to understand the sampling and measurement properties of the different types of species-area curves.},

In each$\backslash$nsampled data set the linear relation of Simpson and Sorensen similarity$\backslash$nto geographic distance (on both log-transformed and original scales)$\backslash$nbetween 100 even-sized equidistant plots was assessed using linear$\backslash$nregression and generalized linear regression with a log-link function.$\backslash$nRegressions were applied either including or removing zero similarities$\backslash$nfrom the data.

abstract = {The number of species is known to decrease from the humid tropics towards drier and colder climates, but how species richness varies along environmental and spatial gradients within the tropical rain forests is not clear. We inventoried 214 transects of 0.25 ha to document species diversity patterns in an example plant group (ferns and lycophytes) across non-inundated rain forests of western and central Amazonia, and assessed how well these conformed with proposed hypotheses about species richness. The observed number of species varied between 6 and 71 per transect. The effective number of species (emphasising the degree of unevenness in species abundances) varied between 1.02 and 8.60, and diversity profiles revealed considerable differences among transects in community structure. Although the density of individuals varied over almost two orders of magnitude, species diversity was better explained by other variables. In particular, within-transect species diversity increased substantially with increasing soil cation concentration. It also increased with soil aluminium concentration, heterogeneity in soil chemistry, annual rainfall and dry season rainfall, and was higher in western than in central Amazonia. Multiple regression models explained up to 70{\%} of the variance in species diversity, but the relationships between species diversity and the environmental gradients became progressively weaker as species abundances were given more weight in the calculation of diversity. Our results conformed to the proposal that site productivity promotes species diversity. This seemed to arise from larger species pools on more fertile soils and in wetter climates, even when it could be expected that the older and more widespread infertile soils would have provided more opportunities for speciation.},

abstract = {The relationship between local and regional diversity in viperid snake assemblages from South America was estimated. However, viperid species richness was spatially patterned across the continent, and this result can bias significance levels of regres- sion analyses. To overcome this problem, we determined the minimum distance between localities that ensures stochastic independence of diversity estimates across space, using geostatistical analyses. We analyzed the relationship between local and regional diversity at three different spatial scales, by increasing region size. For the three scales, there was a significant linear relationship between local and regional diversity, indicating that local viperid assemblages are unsaturated and that their local diversity is constrained by species richness of the regional pool. Overall, this result indicates the importance of regional and historical processes on the deter- mination of viperid species richness at local scales.},

abstract = {We investigated the ecogeographic characteristics of 118 Swiss plant species listed as those deserving highest conservation priority in a national conservation guide and classified them into the seven Rabinowitz' rarity types, taking geographic distribution, habitat rarity and local population size into account. Our analysis revealed that species with high conservation priority in Switzerland mostly have a very restricted geograph- ic distribution in Switzerland and generally occur in rare habitats, but do not necessar- ily constitute small populations and are generally not endemics on a global scale.More- over, species that are geographically very restricted on a regional scale are not gener- ally restricted on a global scale. By analysing relationships between rarity and IUCN extinction risks for Switzerland, we demonstrated that species with the highest risk of extinction are those with the most restricted geographic distribution; whereas species with lower risk of extinction (but still high conservation priority) include many region- al endemics. Habitat rarity and local population size appeared to be of minor impor- tance for the assessment of extinction risk in Switzerland, but the total number of ful- filled rarity criteria still correlated positively with the severity of extinction risk. Our classification is the first preliminary assessment of the relative importance of each rar- ity type among endangered plant species of the Swiss flora and our results underline the need to distinguish between a regional and a global responsibility for the conser- vation of rare and endangered species},

@article{Hawkins2007,
abstract = {There have been numerous claims in the ecological literature that spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models results in shifts in the partial coefficients, which bias the interpretation of factors influencing geographical patterns. We evaluate the validity of these claims using gridded species richness data for the birds of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the ex-USSR, and Australia. We used richness in 110110 km cells and environmental predictor variables to generate OLS and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) multiple regression models for each region. Spatial correlograms of the residuals from each OLS model were then used to identify the minimum distance between cells necessary to avoid short-distance residual spatial autocorrelation in each data set. This distance was used to subsample cells to generate spatially independent data. The partial OLS coefficients estimated with the full dataset were then compared to the distributions of coefficients created with the subsamples. We found that OLS coefficients generated from data containing residual spatial autocorrelation were statistically indistinguishable from coefficients generated from the same data sets in which short-distance spatial autocorrelation was not present in all 22 coefficients tested. Consistent with the statistical literature on this subject, we conclude that coefficients estimated from OLS regression are not seriously affected by the presence of spatial autocorrelation in gridded geographical data. Further, shifts in coefficients that occurred when using SAR tended to be correlated with levels of uncertainty in the OLS coefficients. Thus, shifts in the relative importance of the predictors between OLS and SAR models are expected when small-scale patterns for these predictors create weaker and more unstable broad-scale coefficients. Our results indicate both that OLS regression is unbiased and that differences between spatial and nonspatial regression models should be interpreted with an explicit awareness of spatial scale.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

@article{Hillebrand2002,
abstract = {The impact of regional factors (such as speciation or dispersal) on the species richness in local communities (SL) has received increasing attention. A prominent method to infer the impact of regional factors is the comparison of species richness in local assemblages (SL) with the total number of species in the region (SR). Linear relations between SR and SL have been interpreted as an indication of strong regional influence and weak influence of interactions within local communities. We propose that two aspects bias the outcome of such comparisons: (1) the spatial scale of local and regional sampling, and (2) the body size of the organisms. The impact of the local area reflects the scales of ecological interactions, whereas the ratio between local and regional area reflects the inherent moment of autocorrelation. A proposed impact of body size on the relation is based on the high dispersal and high abundance of small organisms. We predict strongest linearity between SR and SL for large organisms, for large local areas (less important ecological interactions) and for sampling designs where the local habitat area covers a high proportion of the regional area (more important autocorrelation). We conducted a meta-analysis on 63 relations obtained from the literature. As predicted, the linearity of the relationship between SL and SR increased with the proportion of local to regional sampling area. In contrast, neither the body size of the organisms nor the local area itself was significantly related to the relation between SL and SR. This indicated that ecological interactions played a minor role in the shape of local to regional richness plots, which instead was mainly influenced by the sampling design. We found that the studies published so far were highly biased towards larger organisms and towards high similarity between the local and regional area. The proposed prevalence of linear relationships may thus be an artefact and plots of SL to SR are not a suitable tool with which to infer the strength of local interactions.},

@article{Lennon2000,
abstract = {I draw attention to the need for ecologists to take spatial structure into account more seriously in hypothesis testing. If spatial autocorrelation is ignored, as it usually is, then analyses of ecological patterns in terms of environmental factors can produce very misleading results. This is demonstrated using synthetic but realistic spatial patterns with known spatial properties which are subjected to classical correlation and multiple regression analyses. Correlation between an autocorrelated response variable and each of a set of explanatory variables is strongly biased in favour of those explanatory variables that are highly autocorrelated – the expected magnitude of the correlation coefficient increases with autocorrelation even if the spatial patterns are completely independent. Similarly, multiple regression analysis finds highly autocorrelated explanatory variables ‘‘significant'' much more frequently than it should. The chances of mistakenly identifying a ‘‘significant'' slope across an autocorrelated pattern is very high if classical regression is used. Consequently, under these circumstances strongly autocorrelated environmental factors reported in the literature as associated with ecological patterns may not actually be significant. It is likely that these factors wrongly described as important constitute a red-shifted subset of the set of potential explanations, and that more spatially discontinuous factors (those with bluer spectra) are actually relatively more important than their present status suggests. There is much that ecologists can do to improve on this situation. I discuss various approaches to the problem of spatial autocorrelation from the literature and present a randomisation test for the association of two spatial patterns which has advantages over currently available methods.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest and progress in the characterization of community structure and community assembly processes through the application of phylogenetic methods. To date most focus has been on groups of taxa for which some relevant detail of their ecology is known, for which community composition is reasonably easily quantified and where the temporal scale is such that speciation is not likely to feature. Here, we explore how we might apply a molecular genetic approach to investigate community structure and assembly at broad taxonomic and geographical scales, where we have little knowledge of species ecology, where community composition is not easily quantified, and where speciation is likely to be of some importance. We explore these ideas using the class Collembola as a focal group. Gathering molecular evidence for cryptic diversity suggests that the ubiquity of many species of Collembola across the landscape may belie greater community complexity than would otherwise be assumed. However, this morphologically cryptic species-level diversity poses a challenge for attempts to characterize diversity both within and among local species assemblages. Recent developments in high throughput parallel sequencing technology, combined with mtDNA barcoding, provide an advance that can bring together the fields of phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis to bear on this problem. Such an approach could be standardized for analyses at any geographical scale for a range of taxonomic groups to quantify the formation and composition of species assemblages.},

Rarely considered ill understanding size-diversity relationships is the history of community assembly. I conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment with freshwater protists and rotifers to test for interactive effects of assembly history and ecosystem size oil species diversity. The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four assembly sequences and four ecosystem sizes as treatments. Community dynamics were monitored for about 50-100 generations. The results show that history affected diversity more strongly in smaller ecosystems, presumably owing to greater priority effects. Consequently. history determined when diversity was significantly related to ecosystem size. The results also suggest that long-term transient community dynamics can make assembly history important for community structuring even in the absence of alternative stable states. Because species immigration is essentially stochastic, ecosystem size is variable. and priority effects can be strong in many natural systems, the history X size interaction revealed in this Study also has the potential to shape natural size-diversity patterns.},

abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

abstract = {In this study, flood frequency, productivity, and spatial heterogeneity were correlated with plant species richness (SR) among wetlands on a coastal island in southeast Alaska. Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and SR, productivity and SR, and linear relations between SR and the spatial variation of flood frequencies (SVFF) within a site. SVFF is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating SR to flood frequency and SVFF explained much of the variation in SR between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high SVFF were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low SVFF were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances.The data also support Michael Huston{\&}{\#}8217;s dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns. Species-rich sites had low to intermediate levels of productivity and intermediate flood frequencies, and species-poor sites had very low or high flood frequencies and low productivity, supporting the model{\&}{\#}8217;s predictions. The model was tested at contrasting spatial scales (1000 m2 and 1 m2). At the 1000-m2 scale, Huston{\&}{\#}8217;s model predicted 78{\&}{\#}37; of the variation in SR.

For 280 plant species from two global data sets, we found that potential carbon gain (photosynthesis) and carbon loss (respiration) increase in similar proportion with decreasing leaf life-span, increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, and increasing leaf surface area-to-mass ratio. Productivity of individual plants and of leaves in vegetation canopies also changes in constant proportion to leaf life-span and surface area-to-mass ratio.

This mechanistic focus narrowed ecology's purview to local scales of time and space, and mostly excluded large-scale phenomena and historical explanations. In parallel, biogeography became more analytical with the acceptance of plate tectonics and the development of phylogenetic systematics, and began to pay more attention to ecological factors that influence large-scale distributions. This trend towards unification exposed problems with terms such as 'community' and 'niche,' in part because ecologists began to view ecological communities as open systems within the contexts of history and geography. The papers in this issue represent biogeographic and ecological perspectives and address the general themes of (i) the niche, (ii) comparative ecology and macroecology, (iii) community assembly, and (iv) diversity. The integration of ecology and biogeography clearly is a natural undertaking that is based on evolutionary biology, has developed its own momentum, and which promises novel, synthetic approaches to investigating ecological systems and their variation over the surface of the Earth. We offer suggestions on future research directions at the intersection of biogeography and ecology.},

abstract = {In this paper, I review the relevance of the niche to biogeography, and what biogeography may tell us about the niche. The niche is defined as the combination of abiotic and biotic conditions where a species can persist. I argue that most biogeographic patterns are created by niche differences over space, and that even 'geographic barriers' must have an ecological basis. However, we know little about specific ecological factors underlying most biogeographic patterns. Some evidence supports the importance of abiotic factors, whereas few examples exist of large-scale patterns created by biotic interactions. I also show how incorporating biogeography may offer new perspectives on resource-related niches and species interactions. Several examples demonstrate that even after a major evolutionary radiation within a region, the region can still be invaded by ecologically similar species from another clade, countering the long-standing idea that communities and regions are generally 'saturated' with species. I also describe the somewhat paradoxical situation where competition seems to limit trait evolution in a group, but does not prevent co-occurrence of species with similar values for that trait (called here the 'competition-divergence-co-occurrence conundrum'). In general, the interface of biogeography and ecology could be a major area for research in both fields.},

abstract = {Recent research has highlighted interdependencies between dispersal and other life-history traits, i.e. dispersal syndromes, thereby revealing constraints on the evolution of dispersal and opportunities for improved ability to predict dispersal by considering suites of dispersal-related traits. This review adds to the growing list of life-history traits linked to spatial dispersal by emphasising the interdependence between dispersal through space and time, i.e. life-history diversity that distributes individuals into separate reproductive events. We reviewed the literature that has simultaneously investigated spatial and temporal dispersal to examine the prediction that traits of these two dispersal strategies are negatively correlated. Our results suggest that negative covariation is widely anticipated from theory. Empirical studies often reported evidence of weak negative covariation, although more complicated patterns were also evident, including across levels of biological organisation. Existing literature has largely focused on plants with dormancy capability, one or two phases of the dispersal process (emigration and/or transfer) and a single level of biological organisation (theory: individual; empirical: species). We highlight patterns of covariation across levels of organisation and conclude with a discussion of the consequences of dispersal through space and time and future research areas that should improve our understanding of dispersal-related life-history syndromes.},

abstract = {Although the maintenance of diversity of living systems is critical for ecosystem functioning, the accelerating pace of global change is threatening its preservation. Standardized methods for biodiversity assessment and monitoring are needed. Species diversity is one of the most widely adopted metrics for assessing patterns and processes of biodiversity, at both ecological and biogeographic scales. However, those perspectives differ because of the types of data that can be feasibly collected, resulting in differences in the questions that can be addressed. Despite a theoretical consensus on diversity metrics, standardized methods for its measurement are lacking, especially at the scales needed to monitor biodiversity for conservation and management purposes. We review the conceptual framework for species diversity, examine common metrics, and explore their use for biodiversity conservation and management. Key differences in diversity measures at ecological and biogeographic scales are the completeness of species lists and the ability to include information on species abundances. We analyse the major pitfalls and problems with quantitative measurement of species diversity, look at the use of weighting measures by phylogenetic distance, discuss potential solutions and propose a research agenda to solve the major existing problems.},

abstract = {Aim Differentiation of sites or communities is often measured by partitioning regional or gamma diversity into additive or multiplicative alpha and beta components. The beta component and the ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) are then used to infer the compositional differentiation or similarity of the sites. There is debate about the appropriate measures and partitioning formulas for this purpose. We test the main partitioning methods, using empirical and simulated data, to see if some of these methods lead to false conclusions, and we show how to resolve the problems that we uncover. Location South America, Ecuador, Orellana province, Rio Shiripuno. Methods We construct sets of real and simulated tropical butterfly communities that can be unambiguously ranked according to their degree of differentiation. We then test whether beta and similarity measures from the different partitioning approaches rank these datasets correctly. Results The ratio of within-group diversity to total diversity does not reflect compositional similarity, when the Gini–Simpson index or Shannon entropy are used to measure diversity. Additive beta diversity based on the Gini–Simpson index does not reflect the degree of differentiation between N sites or communities. Main conclusions The ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) should not be used to measure the compositional similarity of groups, if diversity is equated with Shannon entropy or the Gini–Simpson index. Conversion of these measures to effective number of species solves these problems. Additive Gini–Simpson beta diversity does not directly reflect the differentiation of N samples or communities. However, when properly transformed onto the unit interval so as to remove the dependence on alpha and N, additive and multiplicative beta measures yield identical normalized measures of relative similarity and differentiation.},

abstract = {Abstract Question: How do spatial patterns and associations of canopy and understorey vegetation vary with spatial scale along a gradi- ent of canopy composition in boreal mixed-wood forests, from younger Aspen stands dominated by Populus tremuloides and P. balsamifera to older Mixed and Conifer stands dominated by Picea glauca? Do canopy evergreen conifers and broad- leaved deciduous trees differ in their spatial relationships with understorey vegetation? Location: EMEND experimental site, Alberta, Canada. Methods: Canopy and understorey vegetation were sampled in 28 transects of 100 contiguous 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats in three forest stand types. Vegetation spatial patterns and relationships were analysed using wavelets. Results: Boreal mixed-wood canopy and understorey vegeta- tion are patchily distributed at a range of small spatial scales. The scale of canopy and understorey spatial patterns generally increased with increasing conifer presence in the canopy. Asso- ciations between canopy and understorey were highly variable among stand types, transects and spatial scales. Understorey vascular plant cover was generally positively associated with canopy deciduous tree cover and negatively associated with canopy conifer tree cover at spatial scales from 5-15 m. Under- storey non-vascular plant cover and community composition were more variable in their relationships with canopy cover, showing both positive and negative associations at a range of spatial scales. Conclusions: The spatial structure and relation of boreal mixed- wood canopy and understorey vegetation varied with spatial scale. Differences in understorey spatial structure among stand types were consistent with a nucleation model of patch dynam- ics during succession in boreal mixed-wood forests.},

abstract = {Null models have proven to be an important quantitative tool in the search for ecological processes driving local diversity and species distribution. However, there remains an important concern that different processes, such as environmental condi- tions and biotic interactions may produce similar patterns in species distributions. In this paper we present an analytical protocol for incorporating habitat suitability as an occupancy criterion in null models. Our approach involves modeling species presence or absence as a function of environmental conditions, and using the estimated site-specific probabilities of occurrence as the likelihood of species occupancy of a site during the generation of ‘‘null communities''. We validated this approach by showing that type I error is not affected by the use of probabilities as a site occupancy criterion and is robust against a variety of predictive performances of the species-en- vironmental models. We describe the expected differences when contrasting classical and the environmentally constrained null models, and illustrate our approach with a data set of Dutch dune hunting spider assemblages. An environmentally constrained approach to null models will provide a more robust evaluation of species associations by facilitating the distinction between mutually exclusive processes that may shape species distributions and community assembly.},

abstract = {Landscape features exist at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and these naturally affect spatial genetic structure and our ability to make inferences about gene flow. This article discusses how decisions about sampling of genotypes (including choices about analytical methods and genetic markers) should be driven by the scale of spatial genetic structure, the time frame that landscape features have existed in their current state, and all aspects of a species' life history. Researchers should use caution when making inferences about gene flow, especially when the spatial extent of the study area is limited. The scale of sampling of the landscape introduces different features that may affect gene flow. Sampling grain should be smaller than the average home-range size or dispersal distance of the study organism and, for raster data, existing research suggests that simplifying the thematic resolution into discrete classes may result in low power to detect effects on gene flow. Therefore, the methods used to characterize the landscape between sampling sites may be a primary determinant for the spatial scale at which analytical results are applicable, and the use of only one sampling scale for a particular statistical method may lead researchers to overlook important factors affecting gene flow. The particular analytical technique used to correlate landscape data and genetic data may also influence results; common landscape-genetic methods may not be suitable for all study systems, particularly when the rate of landscape change is faster than can be resolved by common molecular markers.},

abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare--the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

abstract = {The impact of forest edges on plant species richness is poorly understood. In a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) stand in Southern Qu??bec, variations in species richness and spatial pattern were observed as a function of distance to the edge and were associated with different environmental variables. Unexpectedly, light was not higher and soil moisture and organic matter were not lower close to the edge than in the forest interior: edge structure was most likely responsible for these results. At a 2 m2 scale, richness tended to decrease with distance to the edge, as did fine-scale species turn-over. Erythronium americanum patch size increased with distance to the edge, most likely because of differences in clonal growth along the gradient. Cover of newly emerged seedlings of sugar maple decreased with distance to the edge, in association with soil moisture and pH. Path analyses revealed significant links between environmental (micro-elevation, irradiance, soil organic matter, moisture, and pH) and biotic variables (richness, E. americanum cover, and A. saccharum cover), but only a low proportion of the variance of the biotic variables was explained. At the scale studied, stochastic processes may be more significant than deterministic processes for species richness. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the processes by which species sort themselves into communities remains a central puzzle for attempts to maintain biodiversity. It remains unclear whether any single assembly process is generally dominant or whether the influence of contrasting processes varies in a predictable way relative to biotic and abiotic gradients. Abundance-weighted niche overlap between species provides a powerful means of contrasting two major assembly processes – niche complementarity and environmental filtering. 2. We examined mean overlap for four vegetative functional traits, relative to that expected when abundances were randomly allocated to species co-occurring in experimental plots in a wet meadow. This provided a test of whether any single assembly process prevailed for the meadow as a whole and across all traits. The effects of mowing, fertilization and dominant species removal, and associated gradients of Simpson's dominance and biomass on the niche overlap of plots, were also examined. 3. Niche overlap was higher than expected at random for three of the four traits studied (height, leaf and stem dry matter content, leaf C:N ratio). However, niche overlap was lower than expected for specific leaf area. 4. Mowing was the treatment with the greatest effect on both niche overlap and biomass, with overlap significantly lower in the absence of mowing for three of the traits, while biomass was lower in mown plots. For three of the traits there was evidence of a significant decrease in overlap with increasing biomass, but not increasing dominance. None of the significant mowing effects on overlap remained when the effect of biomass had been removed. 5. Synthesis: These results suggest that the importance of niche differences between species in structuring grassland communities should increase with increasing biomass and decrease with disturbance in grassland communities. They also emphasize that contrasting community assembly processes may occur for different niche axes, even within a single community.},

abstract = {Summary Models describing the biotic drivers that create and maintain biological diversity within trophic levels have focused primarily on negative interactions (i.e. competition), leaving marginal room for positive interactions (i.e. facilitation). We show facilitation to be a ubiquitous driver of biodiversity byfirst noting that all species use resources andthus changethe local biotic or abiotic conditions, altering the available multidimensional niches. This can cause a shift in local species composition, which can cause an increase in beta, and sometimes alpha, diversity.Weshowthat these increases are ubiquitous across ecosystems. These positive effects on diversity occur via a broad host of disparate direct and indirect mechanisms. We identify and unify several of these facilitative mechanisms and discuss why it has been easy to underappreciate the importance of facilitation.Weshowthat net positive effectshavealong history ofbeing considered ecologically or evolutionarily unstable, and we present recent evidence of its potential stability. Facilitation goes well beyond the common case of stress amelioration and it probably gains importance as community complexity increases. While biodiversity is, in part, created by species exploiting many niches, many niches are available to exploit only because species create them. ‘Simultaneous},

abstract = {For several epiphyte species, dispersal limitationandmetapopulationdynamicshavebeen suggested. We studied the relative importance of local environmental conditions and spatial aggregation of species richness of facultative and obligate epiphytic bryophytes and lichens within two old-growth forests in eastern Sweden. The effect of the local environment was analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM). We tested whether species richness was spatially structured by fitting variogram models to the residuals of the GLM. In addition, we analyzed the species-area relationship (area?/ tree diameter). Different environmental variables explained the richness of different species groups (bryophytes vs lichens, specialists vs generalists, sexual vs asexual dispersal). In most groups, the total variation explained by environmental variables was higher than the variation explained by the spatial model. Spatial aggregation was more pronounced in asexually than in sexually dispersed species. Bryophyte species richness was only poorly predicted by area, and lichen species richness was not explained by area at all. Spatial aggregation may indicate effects of dispersal limitation and metapopulation dynamics oncommunity species richness. Our results suggest that species groups differ in habitat requirements and dispersal abilities; there were indications that presence of species with different dispersal strategies is linked to the age of the host tree. Separate analyses of the species richness of species groups that differ in the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal ability give insights into the processes determining community species richness. The poor species-area relationship, especially in lichens, may indicate species turnover rather than accumulation during the lifetime of the host tree. Epiphyte species extinctions may be mainly caused by deterministic processes, e.g. changes in habitat conditions as the host tree grows, ages and dies, rather than by stochastic population processes},

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

abstract = {Measuring species diversity is critical for ecological research and biodiversity conservation. The separate assessment of within-unit diversity and unit distinctiveness in the form of endemism may lead to biased results when evaluating the importance of a unit for regional diversity. In this paper, we adopt the additive partitioning of species diversity and propose a series of measurements decomposing the contribution of a unit into two components, one based on within-unit species diversity and the other on unit distinctiveness, for species richness and Simpson's index. We also propose a differentiation coefficient to evaluate the distribution of species diversity within and among units and to compare the relative importance of unit distinctiveness and within-unit diversity for regional diversity. Using simulations and a real data set of tree species in a community consisting of nine plots, we compared the proposed method with other ranking methods. The definition of unit-specific additive components of species diversity facilitates diversity scaling in hierarchical systems. The individual components may be used to identify the factors determining the contribution of a unit to larger-scale diversity, while avoiding typical problems associated with the number of endemic species. The ranking of units based on an integrated assessment of ?? and ?? diversity at the unit level provides an objective foundation for determining conservation priorities. ?? 2006 Gesellschaft f??r ??kologie.},

abstract = {1. Fragmentation of tropical forests is one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Understanding how biological and functional attributes of communities respond to fragmentation and, in turn, whether ecosystem functioning is impacted upon are critical steps for assessing the long-term effects and conservation values of forest fragments. Ecosystem functioning can be inferred through functional diversity metrics, including functional richness, evenness, and divergence, which collectively quantify the range, distribution, and uniqueness of functional traits within a community. 2. Our study was carried out in forest remnants of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, which is a global hotspot of threatened biodiversity that has undergone massive deforestation and fragmentation. We focus on trees, which play critical functional roles in forest structure, food provisioning, and carbon storage, to examine community organisation and functional diversity across a gradient of fragmentation, from small to large fragments and at edge versus interior habitats. 3. The interiors of small fragments have marginally higher species richness, but similar community structures, to the interiors of bigger fragments. In contrast, fragment edges suffered significant losses of species and changes in community structure, relative to fragment interiors. 4. Despite shifts in community organisation, functional richness was not impacted by fragmentation, with the same number of functions provided independent of fragment size or proximity to edge. However, functional evenness and functional divergence both increased with decreasing fragment size, while fragment edges had lower functional evenness than interiors did, indicating that the abundance and dominance of functional traits has changed, with negative implications for functional redundancy and ecosystem resilience. At fragment edges, large-fruited trees, critical as resources for fauna, were replaced by early successional, small-seeded species. The influence of fragment size was smaller, with a reduction in very large-fruited trees in small fragments counterbalanced by increased numbers of fleshy-and medium-fruited trees. Wood density was not impacted by fragmentation. 5. Synthesis. These results suggest that the interiors of even small fragments can contain important biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and carbon stores, offering potential opportunities for co-benefits under existing carbon markets. Retaining forest fragments is an important conservation strategy within the highly threatened Brazilian Atlantic forest biome},

abstract = {Question: Many calcareous grasslands in Europe have declined in species richness in recent decades. This loss of species could be partly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to increased distances and reduced connectivity through seed flow between calcareous grassland patches resulting in increased local extinction risk related to small population size, and partly due to abandonment of traditional management practices that fostered dispersal within and between patches. Here, we quantify short- and intermediate-distance dispersal ability of dry calcareous grassland species and relate these to dispersal traits. Location: Schaffhauser Randen, Switzerland. Methods: We studied wind dispersal of diaspores under natural conditions within and beyond two replicate calcareous grassland patches. Funnel traps (n = 230) were set up at heights of 0.2 m and 0.7 m along ten transects traversing the calcareous grassland and extending 40 m into the surrounding landscape. We developed a new method for quantifying short - (0-1 m) and intermediate-distance (1-40 m) dispersal ability, related these to species traits, and tested whether they were able to explain dispersal rates into the adjacent landscape. Results: While grasses could be categorized as good dispersers over short or intermediate distances, or both, forbs were generally poor dispersers over both distance classes. Only small numbers of diaspores were found in the adjacent landscape, and these were predominantly grasses. Diaspore traits, such as terminal velocity or diaspore mass, contributed little to explaining dispersal ability, whereas release height was an important predictor, especially for intermediate-distance dispersal. Conclusions: Under natural field conditions, dispersal into the adjacent landscape depends on release height rather than terminal velocity, and is heavily biased towards grasses, so that seed rain does not reflect the species composition of the calcareous grassland community. Thus natural regeneration of species richness of degenerated calcareous grassland communities even over short distances should not rely on wind dispersal alone. Habitat loss, fragmentation and abandonment of traditional management practices have reduced connectivity by seed flow between Europe's calcareous grassland patches. Here we quantify the wind dispersal ability of calcareous grassland species using funnel traps. We show that dispersal into the adjacent landscape is species-specific and conclude that natural regeneration even over short distances should not rely on wind dispersal alone. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {1. Climate and land-use changes will require species to move large distances following shifts in their suitable habitats, which will frequently involve traversing intensively human-modified landscapes. Practitioners will therefore need to evaluate and act to enhance the degree to which habitat patches scattered throughout the landscape may function as stepping stones facilitating dispersal among otherwise isolated habitat areas. 2. We formulate a new generalized network model of habitat connectivity that accounts for the number of dispersing individuals and for long-distance dispersal processes across genera- tions. By doing so, we bridge the gap between complex dynamic population models, which are generally too data demanding and hence difficult to apply in practical wide-scale decision- making, and simpler static connectivity models that only consider the amount of habitat that can be reached by a single average disperser during its life span. 3. We find that the loss of intermediate and sufficiently large stepping-stone habitat patches can cause a sharp decline in the distance that can be traversed by species (critical spatial thresholds) that cannot be effectively compensated by other factors previously regarded as crucial for long-distance dispersal (fat-tailed dispersal kernels, source popula- tion size). 4. We corroborate our findings by showing that our model largely outperforms previous con- nectivity models in explaining the large-scale range expansion of a forest bird species, the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, over a 20-year period. 5. The capacity of species to exploit the opportunities created by networks of stepping-stone patches largely depends on species-specific life-history traits, suggesting that species assem- blages traversing fragmented landscapes may be exposed to a spatial filtering process driving long-term changes in community composition. 6. Synthesis and applications. Previous static connectivity models seriously underestimate the importance of stepping-stone patches in sustaining rare but crucial dispersal events. We provide a conceptually broader model that shows that stepping stones (i) must be of sufficient size to be of conservation value, (ii) are particularly crucial for the spread of species (either native or inva- sive) or genotypes over long distances and (iii) can effectively reduce the isolation of the largest habitat blocks in reserves, therefore largely contributing to species persistence across wide spa- tial and temporal scales.

abstract = {Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolu- tionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa.We propose a statistical frame- work to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occur- rence in gridded environmental space to calculatemetrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the frame- work when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geo- graphical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space tomultivariate environmental space independent of both sam- pling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space.However, the use of ordination and species distributionmodel techniques for selecting, combin- ing and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrast- ing results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographi- cal distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time. Keywords},

abstract = {Animal-mediated pollination is essential for both ecosystem services and conservation of global biodiversity, but a growing body of work reveals that it is negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. Landscape-scale disturbance results in two often inter-related processes: (1) habitat loss, (2) disruptions of habitat configuration (i.e. fragmentation). Understanding the relative effects of such processes is critical in designing effective management strategies to limit pollination and pollinator decline. We reviewed existing published work from 1989 to 2009 and found that only six of 303 studies considering the influence of landscape context on pollination separated the effects of habitat loss from fragmentation. We provide a synthesis of the current landscape, behavioural, and pollination ecology literature in order to present preliminary multiple working hypotheses explaining how these two landscape processes might independently influence pollination dynamics. Landscape disturbance primarily influences three components of pollination interactions: pollinator density, movement, and plant demography. We argue that effects of habitat loss on each of these components are likely to differ substantially from the effects of fragmentation, which is likely to be more complex and may influence each pollination component in contrasting ways. The interdependency between plants and animals inherent to pollination systems also has the possibility to drive cumulative effects of fragmentation, initiating negative feedback loops between animals and the plants they pollinate. Alternatively, due to their asymmetrical structure, pollination networks may be relatively robust to fragmentation. Despite the potential importance of independent effects of habitat fragmentation, its effects on pollination remain largely untested. We postulate that variation across studies in the effects of 'fragmentation' owes much to artifacts of the sampling regimes adopted, particularly (1) incorrectly separating fragmentation from habitat loss, and (2) mis-matches in spatial scale between landscapes studied and the ecological processes of interest. The field of landscape pollination ecology could be greatly advanced through the consideration and quantification of the matrix, landscape functional connectivity, and pollinator movement behaviour in response to these elements. Studies designed to disentangle the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are essential for gaining insight into landscape-mediated pollination declines, implementing effective conservation measures, and optimizing ecosystem services in complex landscapes.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and topographic variability in agricultural landscapes was investigated, with the aim of determining whether sampling landscape units of 1km2 (LUs) across a gradient of topographic variability is more efficient than a random design for assessing the range of biodiversity in climatically and biogeographically homogenous areas called sub-regions. Representative plant species data from the Swiss biodiversity monitoring programme were analyzed covering a broad environmental gradient of four altitudinal belts and seven biogeographic regions. The focus of the study laid on agricultural areas but the whole dataset was as well analyzed to put the agricultural LUs in a general context. Plant species lists of LUs were used to calculate two diversity components: ECOrichness, the number of ecological plant types per LU (as a measure of beta diversity) and AGROrichness, the number of species of conservation importance for agriculture. Mixed regression models were used to analyse the effects of topographic variability on the two plant diversity components, including sub-regions (areas with the same combination of altitudinal belt and biogeographic region) as random factor. These analyses were performed for the whole dataset (419 LUs within 22 sub-regions) and for the focal subset of 187 agricultural LUs within 13 sub-regions. ECOrichness increased significantly with topographic variability for both the general and the agricultural dataset. The partial correlations within the sub-regions revealed consistent trends for the agricultural LUs but some inconsistencies for the whole dataset. For the monitoring of agricultural LUs the sampling along a gradient of topographic variability is therefore suggested as an efficient means for assessing the range of plant species diversity within sub-regions. Compared to other measures of landscape heterogeneity like habitat heterogeneity, sampling LUs along topographic variability is cheap and easily applied and it was demonstrated to work over large environmental gradients. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that variation in abiotic site conditions influences the number of niches, which in turn affects the potential species richness in an area. Based on theoretical considerations, abiotic variation is often used as an estimator of species richness at broad scales, while at finer landscape scales the diversity of habitat types is used. However, habitat estimators assume the landscape to be composed of discrete, homogeneous patches with sharp boundaries, and such a concept is hard to apply in gradient-dominated landscapes. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of topographic variability (TV) on species richness at the landscape level (gamma (gamma) diversity) and on its components (alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) diversity) at microsite and habitat group levels. Using floristic data from 12 "landscapes" of 1 km(2) we investigated the influence on diversity components of two simple and one complex measures of TV. While the standard deviation (SD) of altitude explained a high proportion of the variation in gamma diversity (linear regression model, R-2=0.63), the complex measure, SD of solar radiation explained it even better (R-2=0.82). There were strong effects of TV on alpha and beta diversity components at the microsite level, but only marginal increases of the diversity components at the habitat level. Further analyses revealed that the missing increase of the habitat level components was caused by differences between habitat groups and that only grassland diversity components increased significantly with TV. We conclude that TV at a landscape scale has strong effects on niche or microsite diversity and is an appropriate estimator of relative species richness in landscapes that are topographically heterogeneous and gradient dominated.},

abstract = {This article reviews the application of some summary statistics from current theory of spatial point processes for extracting information from spatial patterns of plants. Theoretical measures and issues connected with their estimation are described. Results are illustrated in the context of speci?c ecological questions about spatial patterns of trees in two forests. 2. The pair correlation function, related to Ripley's K function, provides a formal measure of the density of neighbouring plants and makes precise the general notion of a plants-eye view of a community. The pair correlation function can also be used to describe spatial relationships of neighbouring plants with different qualitative properties, such as species identity and size class. 3. The mark correlation function can be used to describe the spatial relationships of quantitative measures (e.g. biomass). We discuss two types of correlation function for quantitative marks. Applying these functions to the distribution of biomass in a temperate forest, it is shown that the spatial pattern of biomass is uncoupled from the spatial pattern of plant locations. 4. The inhomogeneous pair correlation function enables ?rst-order heterogeneity in the environment to be removed from second-order spatial statistics. We illustrate this for a tree species in a forest of high topographic heterogeneity and show that spatial aggregation remains after allowing for spatial variation in density. An alternative method, the master function, takes a weighted average of homogeneous pair correlation functions computed in subareas; when applied to the same data and compared with the former method, the spatial aggregations are smaller in size. 5. Synthesis. These spatial statistics, especially those derived from pair densities, will help ecologists to extract important ecological information from intricate spatially correlated plants in populations and communities {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

In this paper, we survey tools appropriate for the quantification of static spatial patterns related to geographical ranges and their borders. We then build on these static methods to consider the problem of changes in geographic range through time. Methods discussed are illustrated using lark sparrow data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. While there is no such thing as the ‘‘best'' or ‘‘only'' method to analyze species geographical range and border, we show that a series of methods can be used in sequence to provide complementary and useful quantitative information for species occupancy of range. Indeed, the location of species' borders estimated at different times can be compared to identify locations where species expand or go locally extinct. The ability to delineate accurately species' ranges will be useful to conservation biologists, managers and ecologists.},

abstract = {In order to understand the capacity of habitats to conserve species, many authors have searched for a species-area relationship (SAR) to evaluate the effect of patch size on species richness in habitat fragments. However, a range of different processes may underlie or obscure this relationship. For woody plant species in forest fragments, as for other taxa, considering forest edges separately in the investigation of SAR is particularly relevant. The objective of our study was to evaluate edge influence on SAR in a fragmented forest landscape in south-western France. To achieve this objective, we considered SAR in two separate spatial portions of the forest fragment: the edge and the forest interior. We also considered SAR for different ecological groups of species based on their shade tolerance and their mode of dispersal, as species can respond differently to habitat reduction depending on their ecological characteristics. In 40 woodlands in an agricultural landscape, we observed the presence/absence of all woody species along parallel walking transects 20-m wide to inventory the total number of species in each woodlot. Vegetation surveys resulted in the identification of 53 woody species, with a total of 23 trees and 30 shrubs, and a number of species per woodlot ranging from 18 to 44. The species richness found in a given woodlot was significantly correlated with its area. When considering the edge and the interior parts of the woodlot separately we found a steeper increase in species richness with area for the part we considered as the edge, compared with the increase found in the interior part of the forest. Our results confirm the contribution of forest edge to forest fragment SAR. Results also underlined the importance of two additional processes that may contribute to SAR: a possible extinction debt of shade-tolerant species in forest edge zones and colonisation by light-demanding species in forest interior zones probably due to disturbances. This approach underlines the importance of taking the edge effect into account when studying the influence of patch size on species richness and the dynamic of species richness pattern. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Functional diversity (FD) is an important concept for studies of both ecosystem processes and community assembly, so it is important to understand the behaviour of common metrics used to express it. 2. Data from an existing study of the relationship between FD and environmental drivers were used to simulate the impact of a progressive failure to measure the traits of all the species present under three scenarios: intraspecific variation between sites ignored (i), assessed (ii) or (iii) ignored but with metrics calculated at the sampling unit rather than the site level. 3. All the FD metrics were highly sensitive to failing to measure the traits of all the species present. Functional dispersion, functional richness and Rao's entropy all generally declined with a reduced proportion of species or cover assessed for traits, whilst functional divergence and evenness increased for some sites and decreased for others. Functional richness was the most sensitive (mean absolute deviation at 70{\%} of species assessed had a range of 11.2–28.2{\%} across scenarios), followed by functional evenness (range 6.4–38.5{\%}), functional divergence (5.2–8.3{\%}), Rao's entropy (1.4–7.0{\%}) and functional dispersion (0.7–3.5{\%}). 4. It is clear that failing to measure the traits of all species at a site can have a serious impact on the value of any functional trait metric computed and on any conclusions drawn from such data. Future studies of FD need to concentrate on the potential impact of the sampling regime of both traits and species and the scale at which the computations are made on the behaviour of metrics and subsequent robustness of the results.},

abstract = {1.?We sought evidence for limiting similarity, a basic aspect of community structure, in three zones of a saltmarsh. Sampling was conducted at three spatial scales (grains), from a single point up to the scale of several square metres. Twenty-three functional traits, related to the structure of the shoot and root systems and to nutrient status, were measured on each species present, separately in each community. 2.?Patterns of association between plant species were compared with those expected under a null model, to assess whether plants with similar functional traits tended to coexist or to separate, i.e. whether there was environmental filtering or limiting similarity. A patch null model was used, a type that tends to be conservative but that avoids spurious evidence of limiting similarity caused by environmental pseudoreplication. One overall and four univariate test statistics were calculated, to capture possible patterns in trait space whilst minimising the problem of multiple testing. 3.?In the Shrub community, overall evidence for even spacing of co-occurring species in functional-trait space, the pattern expected from the theory of limiting similarity, was seen at the area scale. In univariate tests in that community, there was evidence for even spacing in leaf lobation and leaf succulence, especially at small scales. 4.?In the Rush community, there was significant evidence for limiting similarity in several traits, especially those related to canopy interactions, but also in some root characteristics. However, clustering in other traits, presumably owing to microenvironmental filtering, reduced overall tests for limiting similarity to ?marginal significance? (0.1 {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} 0.05). 5.?In the species-poor and salt-stressed Salt turf, significant departures from the null model were sporadic and not consistent, although chlorophyll characters and leaf nitrogen concentration tended to be clustered. 6.?Synthesis:?There was evidence for niche limitation in two of the communities ? Rush and Shrub ? apparently based on canopy interactions in both cases and perhaps also root interactions in the latter community. Limiting similarity can be an important force in community assembly. However, in situations when it cannot be demonstrated, we do not know whether trait-based competition is absent or whether its signal is overwhelmed by other processes.},

abstract = {Ecological communities show extremely complex patterns of variation in space, and quantifying the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors underpinning patterns of species distributions is one of the main goals of community ecology. Although we have accumulated good knowledge about the processes driving species distributions within metacommunities, we have few insights about whether (and how) environmental and spatial features can actually generate consistent species distributional patterns across multiple metacommunities. In this paper we applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to identify and classify metacommunities according to multiple but discrete patterns of species distributions. Given that each pattern has unique underlying structuring mechanisms, exploring and comparing such patterns across multiple metacommunities spanning large geographical areas provides a way to test the existence of general principles underlying species distributions within metacommunities. In this study, we applied the EMS framework into a data set containing about 9000 lakes distributed across 85 fish metacommunities across Ontario, Canada, and estimated the relative importance of local and spatial factors in explaining their distributional patterns. Nested and Clementsian gradients were the patterns that fitted most metacommunities; nested metacommunities were distributed throughout the province, while Clementsian gradient metacommunities were concentrated in the southeastern region. Sixty-five percent of nested metacommunities were located in low-energy watersheds (i.e., colder climate and shorter growing season), whereas metacommunities representing Clementsian gradients were present in high-energy watersheds (i.e., relatively warmer climate and longer growing season). Taken together, our results reveal that the environmental and spatial properties in which metacommunities are embedded are at least partially responsible for their species distributional patterns.},

@article{Dormann2007,
abstract = {Aim Spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, i.e. the higher similarity of closer samples, is a common phenomenon in ecology. SAC is starting to be considered in the analysis of species distribution data, and over the last 10 years several studies have incorporated SAC into statistical models (here termed 'spatial models'). Here, I address the question of whether incorporating SAC affects estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models. Methods I review ecological studies that compare spatial and non-spatial models. Results In all cases coefficient estimates for environmental correlates of species distributions were affected by SAC, leading to a mis-estimation of on average c. 25{\%}. Model fit was also improved by incorporating SAC. Main conclusions These biased estimates and incorrect model specifications have implications for predicting species occurrences under changing environmental conditions. Spatial models are therefore required to estimate correctly the effects of environmental drivers on species present distributions, for a statistically unbiased identification of the drivers of distribution, and hence for more accurate forecasts of future distributions},

@article{Gallardo-Cruz2010,
abstract = {The importance of space as an ecological factor is an emerging paradigm in community ecology, particularly as a driving force of biodiversity patterns. We analysed $\beta$-diversity linked to spatial structure in four communities (tropical dry forest, savanna, xerophytic vegetation, subdeciduous forest) that occur in a tropical complex landscape of southern Mexico. The landscape was described through an object-oriented classification of a Quickbird satellite image. The classification re- vealed a highly heterogeneous spatial arrangement of the four communities. Global (landscape-level) $\beta$-diversity was 0.12 (mean S{\o}rensen index), a value smaller than those observed for the individual communities (0.20 0.41). By using multivariate classic and partial Mantel tests, and Mantel correlograms based on two distance classes, we analysed $\beta$-diversity spatial variation related to landscape configuration. The Mantel statistic values for the four communities combined were negative and very similar both for the classic Mantel (rM = -0.23) and the partial Mantel test (rM = -0.19). Correlograms proved significant spatial autocorrelation across most of the analysed distance classes, except in the case of riparian subdeciduous forest. Tropical dry forest and savanna occupy large, highly connected areas in the landscape. Correlograms for these two communities showed decreasing trends, starting at positive, significant autocorrelation values at short distances. The loss of floristic autocorrelation beyond a 5000 m distance for the tropical dry forest may reflect spatially autocorrelated dispersal, and thus a dispersal-limited community. Xerophytic vegetation displayed a distinctly different correlogram, with a wavy shape showing an alternation of positive and negative values, in agreement with the insular configuration of this community in the landscape. We suggest that the routinely incorporation of a spatial approach in community ecology research will help in furthering our understanding of the elusive issues of species turnover across space.},

@article{Olff1998,
abstract = {We propose a new method to obtain information about processes that structure plant communities. We analysed the relationship between the presence and dominance of species across a range of habitats. A simple regression model was used to describe this relationship for each species. Based on the regression parameters, we distinguished globally dominant species, which dominate in the same proportion of plots within a habitat as in which they occur, locally dominant species, which reach dominance only when present in almost every plot of a habitat, and inrinsically subordinate species, which never attain dominance. We tested this method using a large data set of species occurrences across a range of salt marsh habitats. The relationships between presence and dominance could be described well by the regressions and showed large differences between the species. Global dominants occurred later in the succession and higher on the elevational gradient than intrinsically subordinate species. Local dominants were characteristic of early successional stages. These patterns are discurssed in the light of colonisation-competition and tolerance-competition trade-offs},

@article{Ramette2007,
abstract = {Spatial distance (SD) and environmental heterogeneity (EH) are currently thought to represent major factors shaping genetic variation and population abundance, but their relative importance is still poorly understood. Because EH varies at multiple spatial scales, so too are microbial variables expected to vary. The determination of SD x EH interactions at multiple scales is, however, not a trivial exercise, especially when one examines their effects on microbial abundance and genomic similarities. Here we assessed those interactions at all scales perceptible in a patchy environment composed of known plant species and of heterogeneous soil physical and chemical parameters. For free-living, soil-borne Burkholderia ambifaria, genomic similarities responded to most of the spatial scales that the experimental sampling scheme could reveal, despite limited dispersal of the individuals. Species abundance and community composition were, however, responding to much smaller scales more consistent with local responses to EH. Our results suggest that whole-genome similarities may reflect the simultaneous effects of both SD and EH in microbial populations, but the pure effects of each factor only contributed to {\textless} 2{\%} of the total genetic variation. The large amount of unexplained variation that remains after considering most environmental, spatial, and biological interactions is then posited to be the result of noise introduced by unmeasured environmental and spatial variability, sampling effects, and neutral ecological drift.},

abstract = {The field of soil ecology has relatively few fundamental unifying principles that can be used to explain and predict patterns and processes in belowground ecosystems. Here we propose that a first step towards developing a more comprehensive set of unifying principles in soil ecology is to identify and understand the characteristics shared by a wide range of soils, the common mechanisms driving soil biogeochemical processes, and the biogeochemical constraints imposed on soil biota regardless of soil type. Very often, soil ecologists focus on the differences between soils when, in fact, many soils share a common set of ecological mechanisms that govern biogeochemical processes. Here we explore evidence for the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology, highlighting some of the similarities in carbon dynamics and soil communities across widely different soil types and examining the various mechanisms that may drive these similarities. Given that soils are extremely complex environments that exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, defining overarching principles is, arguably, more challenging in soil ecology than in other disciplines. However, recent methodological advances hold great promise for testing and formulating unifying principles, particularly when such methods are used consistently, in concert with other interdisciplinary approaches, and across a range of sites. Soils are not identical, but they do exhibit consistent patterns and processes that, if explored more intensively, will affirm the existence of unifying principles in soil ecology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The aspect and slope can control the movement of water and material in a hillslope and contribute to the spatial differences of soil properties. In a forest ecosystem, soil properties are also influenced by vegetation composition. The objectives of this study are to examine the characteristics and spatial differences of soil properties in a lowland evergreen broad-leaved rain forest in southern Taiwan, and to clarify the relationships between soil properties and the landscape. A total of 565 soil samples were taken at 0-5 and 5-15 cm in 74 contiguous 10 x 10-m quadrates along an altitudinal transect ranging from 300 to 480 m. The study transect was divided in three slope positions: summit, backslope and footslope positions, each with a different floristic composition and structure. Our study showed that organic carbon, available N, available K, extractable Fe and exchangeable Na were highest on the summit, while pH, available P, exchangeable Ca and Mg were significantly higher on the footslope at 0-5-cm soils. Similar patterns were observed at subsurface 5-15-cm depth soils. The OC increased with increasing altitude, probably due to the quality of litterfall and lower rate of decomposition in the summit forest. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) also revealed clear separation of soil properties among slope positions. These results confirmed that slope factor involved in the transport and accumulation of solutes resulted in higher pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg, lower organic carbon, available N and K, extractable Zn in the depositional areas of footslope. Although the soil properties associated with landscape have been better understood, further studies are required to clarify the relationships between soil nutrient status and plants in Taiwan.

abstract = {In this study, we ask if instead of being fundamentally opposed, niche and neutral theories could simply be located at the extremes of a continuum. First, we present a model of recruitment probabilities that combines both niche and neutral processes. From this model, we predict and test whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration.},

abstract = {Abstract Questions: A species' spatial pattern is the outcome of a series of filters: demo- graphic, disturbance, environmental and functional, all varying over space and time. To evaluate the importance of function as a filter we ask: (1) do a species' functional traits allow prediction of its fine-scale spatial patterning, and (2) how consistent is the fine-scale spatial pattern shown by the same species acrossmul- tiple siteswhere the properties of the other filtersmay vary? Location: Species-rich Mediterranean climate shrublands of southwestern Aus- tralia's northern sandplains. Methods: Using fullymapped plots at four sites (each {\textgreater}10 000 individuals, 74– 112 species), we characterized individual species spatial patterning using point pattern analyses. We classified species spatial patterns in three ways: (1) whether they departed from a null model controlling for first-order effects (i.e. are they aggregated?), (2) parameterization of Thomas cluster processes (what form does any clustering take?), and (3) their position in a multivariate ‘pattern space' (do species showdifferent types of pattern?).We then explored the extent to which a species' functional traits, abundance and/or the site at which it occurred predicted these three facets of its spatial pattern. Results: Although at all sitesmost specieswere aggregated, sitewas consistently important in predicting a species' spatial pattern. Regenerative response to fire – whether a species is killed by fire and recruits solely via seeds, or survives and resprouts vegetatively after fire – was the functional traitmost consistently use- ful in predicting a species' spatial pattern. Fire-killed species tended to show more aggregated distributions than resprouters. Species present atmultiple sites did not show consistency in their spatial patterns across those sites more than expected by chance alone. Conclusions: Although functional traits relating to fire responses andwater use predict species spatial distributions at the landscape level, at the fine scales we considered site effectswere as important as functional traits in explaining spatial pattern. Within and between site heterogeneity, some of which can be gener- ated by the stochastic properties of fire, may mask the deterministic effects of species functional traits. Introduction},

abstract = {Phytosociological databases are important data sources for a broad scale of ecological investigations. Vegetation samples are traditionally managed and published in tabular format, allowing for handling of the vegetation data in various combinations. Such tables usually comprise relev{\'{e}}s originated from the same locality, vegetation type and collected by the same investigator. Nevertheless, these relev{\'{e}}s are usually affected by the same bias. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of the effects acting at the level of the table (i.e., ‘locally'), using the example of species removals from groups of relev{\'{e}}s. We examine the effect of the removal of infrequent species on community classification in relation with several data set properties using simulated plot data sampled from simulated coenoclines. A data set comprised groups of relev{\'{e}}s (‘tables'), within which relev{\'{e}}s are sampled from the same point of the coenocline. Classifications obtained after the removal or permutation of infrequent species occurrences from these tables, after the removal of rare species from randomised tables and without any treatment were compared to a reference classification based on gradient positions of the relev{\'{e}}s. The results show that the removal of locally infrequent species helps to recognise the gradient pattern incorporated in the tabular arrangement of relev{\'{e}}s if the arrangement of relev{\'{e}}s among tables is in accordance with their gradient position. In cases when the grouping of relev{\'{e}}s is irrelevant regarding the real underlying pattern, the species removal is disadvantageous. Testing between-table heterogeneity within a data set is an especially successful way of examination of biological relevance of the arrangement of relev{\'{e}}s. We conclude that influence of table-level effects is mainly dependent on the pattern which is in accordance with the grouping of plots.},

I suggest that the distributions of species within a region reveal more about the processes that generate diversity patterns than does the co-occurrence of species at any given point. The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally. Ecologists are moving toward a community concept based on interactions between populations over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales within entire regions, including the population and evolutionary processes that produce new species.},

abstract = {The species richness (diversity) of local plant and animal assemblages-biological communities-balances regional processes of species formation and geographic dispersal, which add species to communities, against processes of predation, competitive exclusion, adaptation, and stochastic variation, which may promote local extinction. During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory.},

@article{GuillaumeBlanchet2014,
abstract = {Understanding how habitat structures species assemblages in a community is one of the main goals of community ecology. To relate community patterns to particular factors defining habitat conditions, ecologists often use canonical ordinations such as canonical redundancy analysis (RDA). It is a common practice to use dissimilarity coefficients to perform canonical ordinations through distance-based RDA (db-RDA) or transformation-based RDA (tb-RDA). Dissimilarity coefficients are measures of resemblance where the information about species communities is condensed into a symmetric square matrix of dissimilarities among sites. In this study, we compared 16 of the most commonly used dissimilarity coefficients to evaluate if the species-abundance distribution (SAD) of a community can be used to select an appropriate coefficient. Of these, 11 are designed to be used primarily with abundance data, although they can also be used with presence–absence data, whereas five can only be applied to presence–absence data. Using simulations, we compared the explained variance of RDAs differing only by their coefficients to evaluate how the abundance patterns of communities influence coefficient choice. We found that coefficients are largely equivalent, independently of the community SAD. In light of these findings, we propose the consensus RDA method, a new canonical ordination procedure that performs a consensus of RDAs across several coefficients. This new method focuses on the common relations found by independent RDAs differing only by their dissimilarity coefficients; this ensures the absence of a coefficient-related bias when interpreting the canonical ordination result. Also, because in our simulations the presence–absence data were directly derived from the abundance data, we were able to evaluate if the information in presence–absence data was equivalent to that in abundance data. We found that although some information was lost by converting abundance data into presence–absence, both data formats may be complementary. When applying consensus RDA to abundance and presence–absence data independently, a more complete understanding and interpretation of the ecological patterns is obtained. An ecological example illustrating consensus RDA and the conclusions of our simulations is presented, using Carabidae data collected at the Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbances (EMEND) project in northwestern Alberta, Canada.},

abstract = {At focal sites within dry sclerophyll woodland and temperate rain forest, species were identified that were of low local abundance and hence in the tail of the rank- abundance curve. We then asked the question: What proportion of tail species within a given community are constitutive members of the tail everywhere throughout their geo- graphical range, versus what proportion are found as substantially more abundant some- where within their range? Out of 55 tail species identified from dry sclerophyll woodland and 116 tail species identified from temperate rain forest, 91{\%} and 95{\%}, respectively, were significantly more abundant at other locations ("somewhere-abundant" species), versus 9{\%} and 5{\%} "everywhere-sparse" species. Among eight attributes in dry sclerophyll woodland and nine attributes in temperate rain forest compared between somewhere-abundant and everywhere-sparse species, none discriminated consistently between the two groups of species. The size and dispersal morphology of seeds, flowering and fruiting durations and seasons, regeneration strategy after fire, size of geographical ranges, maximum plant height, and size class revealed no consistent distinctions. For the small minority of species that are everywhere-sparse, some general explanation may exist as to why they are in the tail of rank-abundance curves, though none was located among the attributes compared in this paper. For the majority of tail species that are somewhere-abundant, any explanation as to why they are in the tail will need to account for different outcomes in different places.},

@article{Burrough2001,
abstract = {Initially, geographical information systems (GIS) concentrated on two issues: automated map making, and facilitating the comparison of data on thematic maps. The first required high quality graphics, vector data models and powerful data bases, the second is based on grid cells that can be manipulated by suites of mathematical operators collectively termed map algebra. Both kinds of GIS are widely available and are taught in many universities and technical colleges. After more than 20 years of development, most standard GIS provide both kinds of functionality and good quality graphic display, but until recently they have not included the methods of statistics and geostatistics as tools for spatial analysis. Recently, standard statistical packages have been linked to GIS for both exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Standard statistical packages include methods for the analysis of random samples of cases or objects that are not necessarily co-located in spaceif the results of statistical analysis display a spatial pattern then that is because the underlying data also share that pattern. Geostatistics addresses the need to make predictions of sampled attributes (i.e., maps) at unsampled locations from sparse, often expensive data. To make up for lack of hard data geostatistics has concentrated on the development of powerful methods based on stochastic theory. Though there have been recent moves to incorporate ancillary data in geostatistical analyses, insufficient attention has been paid to using modern methods of data display for the visualization of results. GIS can serve geostatistics by aiding geo-registration of data, facilitating spatial exploratory data analysis, providing a spatial context for interpolation and conditional simulation, as well as providing easy-to-use and effective tools for data display and visualization. The value of geostatistics for GIS lies in the provision of reliable interpolation methods with known errors, methods of upscaling and generalization, and for supplying multiple realizations of spatial patterns that can be used in environmental modeling. These stochastic methods are improving understanding of how errors in models of spatial processes accrue from errors in data or incompleteness in the structure of the models. New developments in GIS, based on ideas taken from map algebra, cellular automata and image analysis are providing high level programming languages for modeling dynamic processes such as erosion or the development of alluvial fans and deltas. Research has demonstrated that these models need stochastic inputs to yield realistic results. Non-stochastic tools such as fuzzy subsets have been shown to be useful for spatial analysis when probabilistic approaches are inappropriate or impossible. The conclusion is that in spite of differences in history and approach, the linkage of GIS, statistics and geostatistics provides a powerful, and complementary suite of tools for spatial analysis in the agricultural, earth and environmental sciences.},

abstract = {In two articles, we present ‘coregionalization analysis with a drift' (CRAD), a method to assess the multi-scale variability of and relationships between ecological variables from a multivariate spatial data set. In phase I of CRAD (the first article), a deterministic drift component representing the large-scale pattern and a random component modeled as a second-order stationary process are estimated for each variable separately. In phase II (this article), a linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is fitted by estimated generalized least squares to the direct and cross experimental variograms of residuals (i.e., after the removal of estimated drifts). Structural correlations and coefficients of determination at smaller scales are then computed from the estimated coregionalization matrices, while the estimated drifts are used to calculate pseudo coefficients at large scale. The performance of five procedures in estimating correlations and coefficients of determination was compared using a Monte Carlo study. In four CRAD procedures, drift estimation was based on local polynomials of order 0, 1, 2 (L0, L1, L2) or a global polynomial with forward selection of the basis functions; the fifth procedure was coregionalization analysis (CRA), in which large-scale patterns were modeled as a supplemental component in the LMC. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, the uncertainty in the estimation of correlations and coefficients of determination could be related to the interference between spatial components within a bounded sampling domain. In the bivariate case, most procedures provided acceptable estimates of correlations. In regionalized redundancy analysis, uncertainty was highest for CRA, while L1 provided the best results overall. In a forest ecology example, the identification of scale-specific correlations between plant species diversity and soil and topographical variables illustrated the potential of CRAD to provide unique insight into the functioning of complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {We propose a method to test the correlation of two random fields when they are both spatially autocorrelated. In this scenario, the assumption of independence for the pair of observations in the standard test does not hold, and as a result we reject in many cases where there is no effect (the precision of the null distribution is overestimated). Our method recovers the null distribution taking into account the autocorrelation. It uses Monte-Carlo methods, and focuses on permuting, and then smoothing and scaling one of the variables to destroy the correlation with the other, while maintaining at the same time the initial autocorrelation. With this simulation model, any test based on the independence of two (or more) random fields can be constructed. This research was motivated by a project in biodiversity and conservation in the Biology Department at Stanford University.},

abstract = {Aim We evaluate, for the first time, the decay of similarity over distance in four species of marine fishes with different vagility: Trachurus murphyi (pelagic, highly vagile), Merluccius gayi (demersal, highly vagile), Sebastes capensis (demersal, low vagility) and Hippoglossina macrops (benthic, non-vagile). Location We use our own data of the species composition of parasite communities in four host species: T. murphyi (Perciformes), M. gayi (Gadiformes), H. macrops (Pleuronectiformes) and S. capensis (Scorpaeniformes), from the coast of Chile and southern Argentina. Trachurus murphyi, M. gayi and H. macrops in the area studied live closely associated with the cold waters of the Humboldt Current System, while S. capensis in southern Chile is associated with the fjord areas south of c. 43 degrees S, and in Argentina this species lives in close association with the cold water of the Malvinas Current, which mixes with the warm water of the Brazilian Current in the sampled area. Thus, for all four host species there are no known geographical (oceanographic) barriers that interrupt their continuous distributions. Methods Fish were collected and frozen (-18 degrees C) until examination in the laboratory. After thawing, each visceral organ was dissected separately, washed in running water, filtered using a mesh of 0.25 mm, and examined under a stereomicroscope (20x). For S. capensis, only ectoparasites were included in this study because data on endoparasites for some locations are not available. The approach of Poulin [Journal of Biogeography30 (2003) 1609] was used. For each host species, we computed similarity in parasite composition using the Bray-Curtis distance on a presence/absence matrix. Similarity between each pair of localities was correlated (linear regression on raw and transformed data) with the distance (in nautical miles) among those sites. Results Among conspecific populations of host fish, there was no correlation between sample size and parasite species richness. The same pattern was evident when all host populations were pooled and treated as a single sample. Except for H. macrops, an important proportion of the geographical ranges of the host species was covered. The decay in similarity of parasite communities over distance was recorded in three of the four hosts analysed. For H. macrops, no relationship between distances and decay of similarity was evident. A linear regression on non-transformed data provided a good fit, and the regression on log(n + 1) does not change significantly for both r(2) and probability, but slopes are smaller for log-transformed than for non-transformed data. Main conclusions Three of the four fish parasite systems studied fit well with the expected decay of similarity over distance. The slopes of the relationship between distance and similarity in the marine fishes studied are lower, but significant (three orders of magnitude) than those recorded in freshwater fishes by Poulin (2003). In our case, Hippoglossina macrops (benthic, non-vagile host) does not show any relationship, suggesting homogeneity over the geographical area studied for this species.},

@article{Millar2011,
abstract = {Distance decay is used to describe the (usually exponential) decay in ecological similarity of assemblages between two sites as a function of their distance apart along an environmental gradient. Exponential distance–decay curves are routinely fitted by calculating the ecological similarity between each pair of sites, and fitting a linear regression to the points on a scatter plot of log-similarity vs. distance (x-axis). However, pairs of sites where the assemblages have no species in common pose a problem, because the similarity is zero, and the log transformation cannot be applied. Common fixes to this problem (i.e., either removing or transforming the zero values) are shown to have undesirable consequences and to give widely disparate estimates. A new method is presented as a special case of a generalized dissimilarity model. It is fitted very quickly and easily using existing software, and it does not require removal or transformation of the zero similarity points. Its simplicity makes it convenient for use in conjunction with the resampling methods that are routinely employed to test hypotheses, to obtain standard errors of estimated parameters, or to compare distance–decay curves. A word of caution about standard application of the bootstrap is noted, and modified bootstrap and jackknife alternatives are demonstrated.},

abstract = {Little is known about the combined impact of habitat filtering and dispersal limitation on species turnover patterns. To gain new insights, we constructed a spatially explicit community model wherein we controlled dispersal distances, the strength of habitat filtering, and the grain of habitat heterogeneity to study the distance decay of several (dis)similarity indices. The impact of habitat filtering is dependent on the ratio between the grain of habitats and the mean dispersal distance. The behavior of (dis)similarity indices varies. First, incidence-based measures of species overlap are less affected by habitat filtering than are abundance-based indices. Second, species identity-based indices, derived from population genetics' F(ST), show interesting capacities to infer dispersal processes under neutrality but are also highly sensitive to habitat filtering. All indices except F(ST)-related indices under neutrality are very sensitive to overall species richness. Hence, community patterns showing contrasted diversity levels should be compared with caution. Partitioning similarity indices within and between habitats appears to be an efficient approach to assess the strength of habitat filtering, and we show that a torus-translation test is powerful for this purpose. We finally highlight the need for further analytical studies to achieve theoretical expectations of similarity decay under dispersal and niche processes.},

abstract = {The fate of individual plants is strongly influenced by their spatial context (e.g., their location relative to competitors or environmental gradients). Recent theoretical developments indicate that spatial structure in plant communities arises as an outcome of environmental heterogeneity, intra- and interspecific competition, and localized dispersal. Furthermore, each of these forces is predicted to leave a signature on the spatial and temporal pattern within the community. We track the development of spatial structure in successional grasslands in southern California for five years, using a series of large-scale field experiments. We compare the observed changes in spatial structure to the predictions of a spatially explicit model of plant competition in heterogeneous landscapes. We conclude that environmental heterogeneity led to the development of aggregation in the first year at scales of 1–2 m. Over time, aggregation was detectable at distances greater than 4 m, and species become segregated as a result of competition and localized dispersal. Large-scale disturbances (fire) homogenized the community by decreasing the level of aggregation and segregation. In contrast, disturbance by pocket gophers and ground squirrels increased localscale heterogeneity by creating annual-dominated aggregates. The speed with which spatial structure develops in seemingly homogeneous environments illustrates the importance of incorporating spatial context in empirical studies and models of plant community dynamics.},

abstract = {Questions: How does the spatial structure of plant communities vary with the spatial grain and with the measure of species presence used? How can communitiesmost efficiently be sampled for spatial autocorrelation? Location: Four communities – riverbed, bog, ultramafic shrubland/herbfield and forest – in southwest New Zealand. Methods: Each site was sampled over an extent of ca. 120 m at seven spatial grains, from 0.0025 to 25 m2, using an innovative triangular sampling scheme. At the 1-m2 grain, species abundances (local frequencies) were recorded, as well as presence/absence. Results: The percentage variation in species composition explained by distance, i.e. by spatial autocorrelation, was higher at larger grain. However, it reached a maximum of only 15{\%}. The nugget – the Y-intercept of the dissimilarity/ distance relation – has been seen as a measure of randomness in community composition. It was generally about 0.5 dissimilarity on a 0–1 scale, although values in the range 0.7–0.8 were found at smaller grain sizes in the forest. The 90{\%} distance, i.e. the distance at which dissimilarity reaches 90{\%} of its final value, was interpretable only for the two sites where spatial autocorrelation was strong, but gave realistic estimates. Unsurprisingly, some parameter estimates were unrealistic when the fits were poor. Abundance information added nothing to the ability of distance to predict dissimilarity. Conclusion: The strength of spatial autocorrelation rose with increasing grain, to a low value but one congruent with the few comparable studies in the literature. That is, control of species composition seemed to be at the larger grain sizes sampled, rather than at a very fine scale. Strong spatial autocorrelation has been reported only over large extents, over environmental heterogeneity and/or when examining one guild within a community. The nugget was generally somewhat lower than other values in the literature, indicating less randomness. The lack of increased spatial community predictability when including species abundances conforms to the majority of previous studies, suggesting that the primary community control is on the presence of species, not their abundance. However, the differences in spatial autocorrelation between the four sites sampled emphasize that comparative studies using consistent methods are needed. The triangular sampling scheme used here was rapid, accurate, and efficient in its distribution of distances.},

Theory predicts that interactions with neighbors of the same (conspecific) and other (heterospecific) species can influence a species' relative abundance, but empirical tests are lacking. By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species' sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospecific, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.},

abstract = {Spatial scaling to some extent determines biodiversity patterns in larger organisms, but its role in microbial diversity patterns is much less understood. Some studies have shown that bacterial community similarity decreases with distance, whereas others do not support this. Here, we studied soil bacterial communities of tropical rainforest in Malaysia at two spatial scales: a local scale with samples spaced every 5 m over a 150-m transect, and a regional scale with samples 1 to 1,800 km apart. PCR-amplified soil DNA for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene targeting the V1-V3 region was pyrosequenced using Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium platform. A ranked partial Mantel test showed a weak correlation between spatial distance and whole bacterial community dissimilarity, but only at the local scale. In contrast, environmental distance was highly correlated with community dissimilarity at both spatial scales, stressing the greater role of environmental variables rather than spatial distance in determining bacterial community variation at different spatial scales. Soil pH was the only environmental parameter that significantly explained the variance in bacterial community at the local scale, whereas total nitrogen and elevation were additional important factors at the regional scale. We obtained similar results at both scales when only the most abundant OTUs were analyzed. A variance partitioning analysis showed that environmental variables contributed more to bacterial community variation than spatial distance at both scales. In total, our results support a strong influence of the environment in determining bacterial community composition in the rainforests of Malaysia. However, it is possible that the remaining spatial distance effect is due to some of the myriad of other environmental factors which were not considered here, rather than dispersal limitation.},

abstract = {Many of the most interesting questions ecologists ask lead to analyses of spatial data. Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},

abstract = {Patterns of species turnover may reflect the processes driving community dynamics across scales. While the majority of studies on species turnover have examined pairwise comparison metrics (e.g., the average Jaccard dissimilarity), it has been proposed that the species-area relationship (SAR) also offers insight into patterns of species turnover because these two patterns may be analytically linked. However, these previous links only apply in a special case where turnover is scale invariant, and we demonstrate across three different plant communities that over 90{\%} of the pairwise turnover values are larger than expected based on scale-invariant predictions from the SAR. Furthermore, the degree of scale dependence in turnover was negatively related to the degree of variance in the occupancy frequency distribution (OFD). These findings suggest that species turnover diverges from scale invariance, and as such pairwise turnover and the slope of the SAR are not redundant. Furthermore, models developed to explain the OFD should be linked with those developed to explain species turnover to achieve a more unified understanding of community structure.},

abstract = {This study explores the relation between landscape structure and tree species richness in a tropical area suffering deforestation since the second half of the 19th century. Three different null hypotheses were tested: (1) there is no relationship between landscape structure and tree species diversity present in fragments because the process of fragmen- tation in these landscapes is too recent to result in tree species extinction; (2) species characteristics do not influence the relationship between tree richness and landscape struc- ture; (3) scale of analysis does not influence the relationship between tree richness and landscape structure. I studied 11 fragments of mesophytic semideciduous forest occurring along the Jacare ´-Pepira river (southeast Brazil). From a classified Thematic Mapper image, the landscape structure was quantified using parameters of fragment structure, forest ar- rangement, landscape complexity, and landscape composition. To investigate the influence of scale over tree species richness, forest and landscape parameters were evaluated around the studied fragments for three different landscape extents. Each forest fragment community was divided into functional groups according to species dispersal capability and shade tolerance, to distinguish possible differences in landscape perception. The relationships between landscape and community parameters were evaluated with regression and discrim- inant analyses. Results showed significant relations between landscape parameters and species diversity. The nature of these relations changed according to the group and to the landscape extent considered, supporting the view that species perceive the landscape struc- ture differently. The influence of landscape appears to be stronger for shade-tolerant, zo- ochorous, and barochorous species. Shade-tolerant species were particularly influenced by the fragment structure (connectivity). Zoochorous species were particularly sensitive to landscape parameters at broad scales, whereas barochorous species responded mainly to landscape structure at fine scales. These results attest to an influence of the present landscape structure on the tree community, although the time lag of extinction occurring for long- lived trees may be longer than one century. Furthermore, results showed that boundary complexity and fragment connectivity were the most important parameters of landscape linked to the functional group richness and to total diversity, attesting to the importance of the matrix structure in the relationships between landscape and fragmented communities.},

abstract = {Plant-diversity hotspots on a global scale are well established, but smaller local hotspots within these must be identified for effective conservation of plants at the global and local scales. We used the distributions of endemic and endemic-threatened species of Myrtaceae to indicate areas of plant diversity and conservation importance within the Atlantic coastal forests (Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica) of Brazil. We applied 3 simple, inexpensive geographic information system (GIS) techniques to a herbarium specimen database: predictive species-distribution modeling (Maxent); complementarity analysis (DIVA-GIS); and mapping of herbarium specimen collection locations. We also considered collecting intensity, which is an inherent limitation of use of natural history records for biodiversity studies. Two separate areas of endemism were evident: the Serra do Mar mountain range from Paran{\'{a}} to Rio de Janeiro and the coastal forests of northern Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo and southern Bahia. We identified 12 areas of approximately 35 km(2) each as priority areas for conservation. These areas had the highest species richness and were highly threatened by urban and agricultural expansion. Observed species occurrences, species occurrences predicted from the model, and results of our complementarity analysis were congruent in identifying those areas with the most endemic species. These areas were then prioritized for conservation importance by comparing ecological data for each.},

abstract = {Protected areas are widely recognized for their value in the conservation of biodiversity. Their establishment and management sometimes impose costs, however, such as the direct cost of protection and management activities and the opportunity cost to local residents who have to forego natural resource extraction. It is therefore essential that the creation of protected areas be planned systematically to ensure that costs are minimized and benefits maximized. This entails setting targets for the overall set of features that should ideally be conserved through protected areas and defining parameters to assess current protected-area networks and guide their expansion (Margules {\&} Pressey 2000).  The Fifth World Parks Congress (WPC, September 2003, Durban, South Africa, http://iucn.org/themes/wcpa/wpc2003/) provided fertile ground for the discussion of targets for biodiversity conservation planning, particularly through Workshop Stream 7 on "Building Comprehensive Protected Area Systems." Here, we build on these discussions to argue that, despite a range of shortcomings, species data provide the best basis for setting these targets.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is rapidly declining worldwide, and there is consensus that this can decrease ecosystem functioning and services. It remains unclear, though, whether few or many of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered; however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84{\%} of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years, places, functions or environmental change scenarios. Therefore, although species may appear functionally redundant when one function is considered under one set of environmental conditions, many species are needed to maintain multiple functions at multiple times and places in a changing world.},

Previous calls for enhancing PA management have focused on improving operational effectiveness of each PA [e.g., staffing and budgets (6)]. Little guidance has been offered on how to improve collective effectiveness for meeting global biodiversity conservation goals (3).

abstract = {The use of indicator taxa as biodiversity surrogates has received widespread attention in conservation planning, but remains a highly contentious issue. Here we assess biodiversity surrogacy in the two most important biomes of tropical northeastern Brazil, Atlantic forest and Caatinga. We examine the extent to which species richness is correlated among taxonomic groups, and assess relationships between the richness of individual groups, and combinations of groups and total species richness. We introduce a new approach to dealing with autocorrelation between focal taxon richness and total species richness, using standardized data such that each taxon is given equal weight. Our Atlantic forest data covered seven taxa (bryophytes, pteridophytes, trees, ants, euglosine bees, birds, and mammals; total of 768 species) sampled from 12 sites; in Caatinga it was four taxa (trees, spiders, beetles and ants; total of 184 species) from 25 sites. Our results showed that: (1) in nearly all cases the species richnesses of individual taxa were significantly correlated with each other; (2) the species richnesses of most individual taxa were significantly correlated with total species richness in both biomes; (3) only two taxa were required for excellent (R2[80{\%}) surrogacy of total species richness in both biomes; and (4) the same two taxa (trees and ants) can provide reasonable (R2[60{\%}) surrogacy for total richness in these contrasting biomes. Our findings therefore suggest that the ‘shopping basket of taxa' required for effective biodiversity surrogacy may not only need to be very small (two taxa), but may also be very limited in composition.},

abstract = {The phylogenetic clustering of extinction may jeopardize the existence of entire families and genera, which can result in elevated reductions of evolutionary history (EH), trait diversity, and ecosystem functioning. Analyses of globally threatened birds and mammals suggest current extinction threats will result in a much higher loss of EH than random extinction scenarios, while the analyses of the taxonomical distribution of regionally rare plants find the opposite pattern. The disproportionately high number of rare plant species within species-rich families potentially suggests that lower losses of plant EH will be sustained than expected under random extinction. We show that at a global scale, this is not the case. Species-poor (especially monotypic) angiosperm families are more often at risk of extinction than expected. Because these high-risk species-poor families are as evolutionarily distinct as other families, the expected family-level EH plausibly lost in the next 100 years exceeds that predicted from random extinction by up to approximately 1165 million years.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of open access data on species occurrences is leading researchers to generate more hypotheses about patterns of species distributions. However, when all of this information is mapped onto a particular geographical scale, gaps usually appear due to lack of knowledge and sampling spatial bias (the so-called Wallacean shortfall). To overcome these problems as efficiently as possible, field surveys should be designed after distinguishing well-surveyed places from those with incomplete inventories in order to carry out the extra survey effort in those areas not represented environmentally and spatially by the well-surveyed places. This procedure requires (1) gathering, cleaning and standardizing data; (2) selecting environmental variables that are important for the group considered according to field experience and the literature; and (3) making statistical decisions about the number and location of areas that should be surveyed according to the available resources. Here, we summarize most concepts and procedures devoted to the evaluation of biodiversity data, offering some general recommendations on how to use them for optimizing new survey designs. As a practical guide for potential users, we provide an example describing its application to a comprehensive database on bryophyte distribution on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal). More than 8,000 bryophyte records were gathered, but (i) less than half of the island area has been surveyed at least once and (ii) less than 1{\%} of these have reliable inventories (placed on the few remnants of laurel forests that have been traditionally better surveyed). Nevertheless, surveying just 15 additional localities evenly distributed across the major environmental regions and habitats on Terceira Island seems to represent the existing environmental diversity. We believe that the survey protocol presented here for bryophytes of Terceira Island could be flexibly applied to other taxa or areas.},

abstract = {1. Deforestation and forest fragmentation can drive species to local extinction, potentially changing the phylogenetic community structure and diversity of remaining assemblages. We tested this hypothesis analysing a large vegetation data set from a highly fragmented rain forest. 2. We assessed 9000 trees (both saplings and adults) from 268 species in 45 rain forest patches (ranging from{\textless} 1 to 700 ha) in three landscapes with different deforestation levels (4{\%}, 11{\%}, and 24{\%}forest cover) in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We tested whether species density (i.e. number of species per unit area) and phylogenetic structure and diversity differed among landscapes, whether they were related to patch area, and whether the relationships differed among landscapes. 3. Overall, the observed differences in sapling and adult species densities across forest patches and landscapes (e.g. lower species densities in smaller patches) resulted in few and very weak changes in the phylogenetic community structure and diversity. Our results indicate that local extirpation of tree species may occur randomly or uniformly (but not in a clustered manner) throughout the phylogenetic tree, supporting the hypothesis of low phylogenetic conservatism of traits associated with vulnerability to forest fragmentation in the Neotropics. 4. Synthesis. This study indicates that in highly deforested and fragmented rain forests, the local extirpation of tree species does not occur across entire lineages. These novel and hopeful findings have direct implications for the ecology and conservation of fragmented rain forests. The maintenance of phylogenetic diversity in highly fragmented landscapes suggests that ecosystem function and stability may be maintained despite the loss of a number of tree species. We argue that in this unique Neotropical region, both large and small rain forest patches are critical for conserving regional tree evolutionary history.},

In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m 
                        2 seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75{\%} of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8{\%} of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31{\%}). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

The study was carried out in the Coimbra forest (3500 ha), the largest fragment currently found in the Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil. We assessed seed rain during a 1-year period by using a 1500-m long transect (with 100 sampling units) for each habitat. Seeds were categorized according to size, dispersal mode, and vertebrate manipulation. A total of 76,207 seeds belonging to 146 species were collected during the whole study and in average edge received more seeds and species per unit of area during particular periods of time. However, the analysis of all seeds and species recorded in both habitats during the 1-year period revealed that forest interior received a significant higher percentage of medium, large and very large seeds (21.8{\%}) and species (82.6{\%}) in comparison to edge (13.5{\%} of seeds and 57.5{\%} of species). The contribution of large and very large seed species dispersed by vertebrates was also lower in the edge forest as it represented 13.04{\%} of all vertebrate-dispersed species recorded in this habitat vs. 31.5 {\%} in the forest interior. Finally, seeds handled by vertebrates accounted for 5.9{\%} of all seeds in forest edge, and reached 11{\%} in the forest interior. The biased seed rain documented in the Coimbra forest raises the possibility that the creation of forest edges may alter some attributes of seed rain, particularly its content of large-seeded plants and of those dispersed by vertebrates. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Functional diversity has been postulated to be critical for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, but the way it can be disrupted by human-related disturbances remains poorly investigated. Here we test the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation changes the relative contribution of tree species within categories of reproductive traits (frequency of traits) and reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages. The study was carried out in an old and severely fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We used published information and field observations to obtain the frequency of tree species and individuals within 50 categories of reproductive traits (distributed in four major classes: pollination systems, floral biology, sexual systems, and reproductive systems) in 10 fragments and 10 tracts of forest interior (control plots). As hypothesized, populations in fragments and control plots differed substantially in the representation of the four major classes of reproductive traits (more than 50{\%} of the categories investigated). The most conspicuous differences were the lack of three pollination systems in fragments--pollination by birds, flies and non-flying mammals--and that fragments had a higher frequency of both species and individuals pollinated by generalist vectors. Hermaphroditic species predominate in both habitats, although their relative abundances were higher in fragments. On the contrary, self-incompatible species were underrepresented in fragments. Moreover, fragments showed lower functional diversity (H' scores) for pollination systems (-30.3{\%}), floral types (-23.6{\%}), and floral sizes (-20.8{\%}) in comparison to control plots. In contrast to the overwhelming effect of fragmentation, patch and landscape metrics such as patch size and forest cover played a minor role on the frequency of traits. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation promotes a marked shift in the relative abundance of tree reproductive traits and greatly reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages in fragmented landscapes.},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation promote relatively predicable shifts in the functional signature of tropical forest tree assemblages, but the full extent of cascading effects to biodiversity persistence remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypotheses that habitat fragmentation (a) alters the relative contribution of tree species exhibiting different reproductive traits; (b) reduces the diversity of pollination systems; and (c) facilitates the functional convergence of reproductive traits between edge-affected and early-secondary forest habitats (5-32 years old). This study was carried out in a severely fragmented 670-km2 forest landscape of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil. We assigned 35 categories of reproductive traits to 3552 trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) belonging to 179 species, which described their pollination system, floral biology, and sexual system. Trait abundance was calculated for 55 plots of 0.1 ha across four habitats: forest edges, small forest fragments (3.4-83.6 ha), second-growth patches, and core tracts of forest interior within the largest available primary forest fragment (3500 ha) in the region. Edge-affected and secondary habitats showed a species-poor assemblage of trees exhibiting particular pollination systems, a reduced diversity of pollination systems, a higher abundance of reproductive traits associated with pollination by generalist diurnal vectors, and an elevated abundance of hermaphroditic trees. As expected, the reproductive signature of tree assemblages in forest edges and small fragments (edge-affected habitats), which was very similar to that of early second-growth patches, was greatly affected by both habitat type and plot distance to the nearest forest edge. In hyper-fragmented Atlantic forest landscapes, we predict that narrow forest corridors and small fragments will become increasingly dominated by edge-affected habitats that can no longer retain the full complement of tree life-history diversity and its attendant mutualists. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing reserve systems throughout the world contain a biased sample of biodiversity, usually that of remote places and other areas that are unsuitable for commercial activities. A more systematic approach to locating and designing reserves has been evolving and this approach will need to be implemented if a large proportion of today's biodiversity is to exist in a future of increasing numbers of people and their demands on natural resources.},

abstract = {Time-lagged responses of biological variables to landscape modifications are widely recognized, but rarely considered in ecological studies. In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000-2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent developments have highlighted the importance of forest amount at large spatial scales and of matrix quality for ecological processes in remnants. These developments, in turn, suggest the potential for reducing biodiversity loss through the maintenance of a high percentage of forest combined with sensitive management of anthropogenic areas. We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterflies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. Our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Deforestation and forest fragmentation are known major causes of nonrandom extinction, but there is no information about their impact on the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining species assemblages. Using a large vegetation dataset from an old hyper-fragmented landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest we assess whether the local extirpation of tree species and functional impoverishment of tree assemblages reduce the phylogenetic diversity of the remaining tree assemblages. We detected a significant loss of tree phylogenetic diversity in forest edges, but not in core areas of small ({\textless}80 ha) forest fragments. This was attributed to a reduction of 11{\%} in the average phylogenetic distance between any two randomly chosen individuals from forest edges; an increase of 17{\%} in the average phylogenetic distance to closest non-conspecific relative for each individual in forest edges; and to the potential manifestation of late edge effects in the core areas of small forest remnants. We found no evidence supporting fragmentation-induced phylogenetic clustering or evenness. This could be explained by the low phylogenetic conservatism of key life-history traits corresponding to vulnerable species. Edge effects must be reduced to effectively protect tree phylogenetic diversity in the severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest.},

abstract = {The long-term dynamics of plant communities remain poorly understood in isolated tropical forest fragments. Here we test the hypothesis that tropical tree assemblages in both small forest fragments and along forest edges of very large fragments are functionally much more similar to stands of secondary growth (5-65-yr old) than to core primary forest patches. The study was carried out in a severely fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Nine functional attributes of tree assemblages were quantified by sampling all trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) within 75 plots of 0.1 ha distributed in four forest habitats: small forest fragments (3.4-79.6 ha), forest edges, second-growth patches, and primary forest interior areas within a large forest fragment (3500 ha). These habitats were markedly different in terms of tree species richness, and in the proportion of pioneer, large-seeded, and emergent species. Age of second-growth stands explained between 31.4{\%} and 88.2{\%} of the variation in the functional attributes of tree assemblages in this habitat. As expected, most traits associated with forest edges and small forest fragments fell within the range shown by early ({\textless}25-yr old) and intermediate-aged secondary forest stands (25-45-yr old). In contrast to habitat type, tree assemblage attributes were not affected by vegetation type, soil type and the spatial location of plots. An ordination analysis documented a striking floristic drift in edge-affected habitats. Our results suggest that conservation policy guidelines will fail to protect aging, hyper-fragmented landscapes from drastic impoverishment if the remaining forest patches are heavily dominated by edge habitat. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1.Land-use change is the main driver of global biodiversity loss, but its relative impact on species turnover ($\beta$-diversity) across multiple spatial scales remains unclear. Plant communities in fragmented rain forests can undergo declines (floristic homogenization) or increases (floristic differentiation) in $\beta$-diversity. 2.We tested these alternative hypotheses analysing a large vegetation database from a hierarchically nested sampling design (450 plots in 45 forest patches in 3 landscapes with different deforestation levels) at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Differences in $\beta$-diversity across spatial scales (i.e. among plots, among patches, and among landscapes) were analysed using multiplicative diversity decompositions of Hill numbers. 3.Plant $\beta$-diversity among plots within forest patches decreased in landscapes with higher deforestation levels, leading to floristic homogenization within patches. This homogenization process can be explained by the loss of rare and shade-tolerant plant species, and the recruitment and dominance of disturbance-adapted species, and can limit the accumulation of species ($\gamma$-diversity) in landscapes with higher deforestation. 4.Nevertheless, the landscape with the highest deforestation level showed the highest floristic differentiation among patches. This landscape showed the greatest isolation distances between patches; a landscape spatial pattern that can limit the interchange of seeds (and species) between patches. Because the study patches are undergoing secondary succession following disturbances (e.g. logging, edge effects), different disturbance regimes and increased distance among patches could lead to higher $\beta$-diversity. 5.Synthesis. These findings indicate that patterns of floristic homogenization and differentiation depend on the landscape configuration and on the spatial scale of analysis. At the landscape scale, our results suggest that, in accordance with non-equilibrium dynamics and the landscape-divergence hypothesis, patches located in landscapes with different forest cover and different connectivity can experience contrasting successional pathways due to increasing levels of compositional differentiation between patches. These novel findings add further uncertainties to the maintenance of biodiversity in severely deforested tropical landscapes, and have key ecological implications for biodiversity-conservation planning.},

The 4-year old Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) aims to restore 15,000,000. ha of tropical forest in 40 years. The approaches and lessons learned appear transferable, and could help achieve the global restoration targets. Fundamental prerequisites for success include: effective technology undergoing continuous improvement, ongoing teaching, outreach and capacity-building efforts, presence of local intelligentsia, maintaining a clear and transparent legal environment, and presence of effective economic instruments and incentives for landowners. These prerequisites can be achieved by expanding and strengthening the network of stakeholders both in public and private forums that must be aware of macro-economic and social/cultural shifts and trends which may provide opportunities and impose constraints to further restoration activities. Finally, environmental regulations imposing habitat protection and restoration are usually beyond individual land-owners' possibilities and level of interest. Therefore, forest restoration, even in a biodiversity hotspot, must be approached as a potentially sustainable economic activity. Otherwise, private landowners, and most other stakeholders, will not persevere. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation imposes profound impacts on the tropical forest microclimate, but the microclimatic configuration of isolated forest patches and its implications for biodiversity persistence and habitat management are not clear. In this study we assessed a set of 10 aged ({\textgreater} 80 years) fragments (3.0 - 3,500 ha in size) of the Atlantic forest to examine to what extent fragment microclimatic attributes are correlated with distance to the nearest edge as frequently proposed in the literature. We used 129 sampling points and took a total of 516 measures of air temperature and humidity, vapor pressure deficit and light incidence to characterize the microclimate of forest fragments in terms of their relative deviation from the surrounding matrix. Fragments as a whole presented strong internal variation and strongly differed from the microclimate exhibited by the open matrix of sugar-cane fields. Distance to nearest edge, percentage of forest cover around the measurement point, percentage of edge-affected area, and geographical orientation of the nearest edge all proved to have minor effects on the microclimate of forest fragments. Conversely, we identified percentage of forest cover and fragment area as the most significant explanatory variables driving their microclimatic configuration: as forest cover increases at landscape scale, forest microclimate deviates less from the open matrix (a forest-mediated matrix buffering). Our results suggest that microclimatic conditions are spatially complex, as they do not correlate with the distance to the nearest forest edges; rather, they are driven by a forest-mediated buffering of the surrounding matrix that minimizes heat and humidity exchanges between forest and non-forest habitats, thus shaping the microclimatic signature of isolated forest fragments. {\textcopyright} Severino R.

abstract = {The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners' interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past 10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration of riparian areas on private lands in the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings, environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32 ongoing projects, covering 527,982. ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3{\%}), and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3{\%}), than large sugarcane farms (10.0{\%} and 36.9{\%}, respectively for riparian areas and forest cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large sugarcane farms (76.0{\%}) and small mixed farms (92.4{\%}), in view of the low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America and elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Such statement is based on data and conclusions of local floristic and phytosociological studies. However, the studies supporting this idea seldom give a clear definition of the plant group analysed, the scale of the study, nor, most significantly, the forests used for comparisons. Here we compare woody species richness data (≥ 2.5 cm dbh) from the atlantic forest in S{\~{a}}o Paulo to similar data from other neotropical forests. Thereafter, we discuss the major relationships between historical and ecological processes and woody species richness in neotropical forests. Neither data on woody species richness nor characteristics of latitude, altitude, rainfall and soil in the atlantic region is able to support the idea of high woody species richness in the S{\~{a}}o Paulo atlantic forest. Studies using comparable data sets are required in order to characterise woody species richness in all types of the atlantic forest, as well as to suggest the mechanisms responsible for plant richness in different scales.},

abstract = {Knowledge about biodiversity remains inadequate because most species living on Earth were still not formally described (the Linnean shortfall) and because geographical distributions of most species are poorly understood and usually contain many gaps (the Wallacean shortfall). In this paper, we developed models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of hypothetical non-described species, based on the range size frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories) and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency distribution of these species should be similar to the range-restricted species, which have been most recently described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability, for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the set-covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131 real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to a system based on currently known species. This main result can be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be defensible.},

abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

abstract = {The analysis of the phylogenetic structure of communities can help reveal contemporary ecological interactions, as well as link community ecology with biogeography and the study of character evolution. The number of studies employing this broad approach has increased to the point where comparison of their results can now be used to highlight successes and deficiencies in the approach, and to detect emerging patterns in community organization. We review studies of the phylogenetic structure of communities of different major taxa and trophic levels, across different spatial and phylogenetic scales, and using different metrics and null models. Twenty-three of 39 studies (59{\%}) find evidence for phylogenetic clustering in contemporary communities, but terrestrial and/or plant systems are heavily over-represented among published studies. Experimental investigations, although uncommon at present, hold promise for unravelling mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic community structure patterns observed in community surveys. We discuss the relationship between metrics of phylogenetic clustering and tree balance and explore the various emerging biases in taxonomy and pitfalls of scale. Finally, we look beyond one-dimensional metrics of phylogenetic structure towards multivariate descriptors that better capture the variety of ecological behaviours likely to be exhibited in communities of species with hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution.},

abstract = {With the advent of molecular phylogenies the assessment of community assembly processes has become a central topic in community ecology. These processes have focused almost exclusively on habitat filtering and competitive exclusion. Recent evidence, however, indicates that facilitation has been important in preserving biodiversity over evolutionary time, with recent lineages conserving the regeneration niches of older, distant lineages. Here we test whether, if facilitation among distant-related species has preserved the regeneration niche of plant lineages, this has increased the phylogenetic diversity of communities. By analyzing a large worldwide database of species, we showed that the regeneration niches were strongly conserved across evolutionary history. Likewise, a phylogenetic supertree of all species of three communities driven by facilitation showed that nurse species facilitated distantly related species and increased phylogenetic diversity.},

abstract = {The role of intraspecific and interspecific interactions in structuring biotic communities at fine spatial scales is well documented, but the signature of species interactions at coarser spatial scales is unclear. We present evidence that species interactions may be a significant factor in mediating the regional assembly of the Danish avifauna. Because {\textgreater}95{\%} of breeding species (n = 197) are migratory, we hypothesized that dispersal limitation would not be important and that breeding distributions would largely reflect resource availability and autecological habitat preferences. Instead, we detected a striking pattern of spatial segregation between ecologically similar species at two spatial scales with a suite of null models that factored in the spatial distribution of habitats in Denmark as well as population size and biomass of each species. Habitat utilization analyses indicated that community-wide patterns of spatial segregation could not be attributed to the patchy distribution of habitat or to gross differences in habitat utilization among ecologically similar species. We hypothesize that, when habitat patch size is limited, conspecific attraction in concert with interspecific territoriality may result in spatially segregated distributions of ecologically similar species at larger spatial scales. In the Danish avifauna, the effects of species interactions on community assembly appear pervasive and can be discerned at grain sizes up to four orders of magnitude larger than those of individual territories. These results suggest that species interactions should be incorporated into species distribution modeling algorithms designed to predict species occupancy patterns based on environmental variables.},

@article{Duarte2014,
abstract = {Phylobetadiversity is defined as the phylogenetic resemblance between communities or biomes. Analyzing phylobetadiversity patterns among different vegetation physiognomies within a single biome is crucial to understand the historical affinities between them. Based on the widely accepted idea that different forest physiognomies within the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest constitute different facies of a single biome, we hypothesize that more recent phylogenetic nodes should drive phylobetadiversity gradients between the different forest types within the Atlantic Forest, as the phylogenetic divergence among those forest types is biogeographically recent. We compiled information from 206 checklists describing the occurrence of shrub/tree species across three different forest physiognomies within the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Dense, Mixed and Seasonal forests). We analyzed intra-site phylogenetic structure (phylogenetic diversity, net relatedness index and nearest taxon index) and phylobetadiversity between plots located at different forest types, using five different methods differing in sensitivity to either basal or terminal nodes (phylogenetic fuzzy weighting, COMDIST, COMDISTNT, UniFrac and Rao's H). Mixed forests showed higher phylogenetic diversity and overdispersion than the other forest types. Furthermore, all forest types differed from each other in relation phylobetadiversity patterns, particularly when phylobetadiversity methods more sensitive to terminal nodes were employed. Mixed forests tended to show higher phylogenetic differentiation to Dense and Seasonal forests than these latter from each other. The higher phylogenetic diversity and phylobetadiversity levels found in Mixed forests when compared to the others likely result from the biogeographical origin of several taxa occurring in these forests. On one hand, Mixed forests shelter several temperate taxa, like the conifers Araucaria and Podocarpus. On the other hand, tropical groups, like Myrtaceae, are also very representative of this forest type. We point out to the need of more attention to Mixed forests as a conservation target within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest given their high phylogenetic uniqueness.},

abstract = {A key challenge in ecological research is to integrate data from different scales to evaluate the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that influence current patterns of biological diversity. We build on recent attempts to incorporate phylogenetic information into traditional diversity analyses and on existing research on beta diversity and phylogenetic community ecology. Phylogenetic beta diversity (phylobetadiversity) measures the phylogenetic distance among communities and as such allows us to connect local processes, such as biotic interactions and environmental filtering, with more regional processes including trait evolution and speciation. When combined with traditional measures of beta diversity, environmental gradient analyses or ecological niche modelling, phylobetadiversity can provide significant and novel insights into the mechanisms underlying current patterns of biological diversity.},

@article{Leibold2010,
abstract = {Biogeographical, evolutionary and ecological processes interact to regulate patterns in metacommunities. However, as there are few quantitative methods for evaluating their joint effects, resolving this interaction is difficult. We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists have historically used species-area and distance-decay relationships as tools to predict the spatial distribution of biodiversity and the impact of habitat loss on biodiversity. These tools treat each species as evolutionarily equivalent, yet the importance of species' evolutionary history in their ecology and conservation is becoming increasingly evident. Here, we provide theoretical predictions for phylogenetic analogues of the species-area and distance-decay relationships. We use a random model of community assembly and a spatially explicit flora dataset collected in four Mediterranean-type regions to provide theoretical predictions for the increase in phylogenetic diversity - the total phylogenetic branch-length separating a set of species - with increasing area and the decay in phylogenetic similarity with geographic separation. These developments may ultimately provide insights into the evolution and assembly of biological communities, and guide the selection of protected areas.},

abstract = {Some of the most species-rich plant communities occur on ancient, strongly weathered soils, whereas those on recently developed soils tend to be less diverse. Mechanisms underlying this well-known pattern, however, remain unresolved. Here, we present a conceptual model describing alternative mechanisms by which pedogenesis (the process of soil formation) might drive plant diversity. We suggest that long-term soil chronosequences offer great, yet largely untapped, potential as 'natural experiments' to determine edaphic controls over plant diversity. Finally, we discuss how our conceptual model can be evaluated quantitatively using structural equation modeling to advance multivariate theories about the determinants of local plant diversity. This should help us to understand broader-scale diversity patterns, such as the latitudinal gradient of plant diversity.},

@article{Link2006b,
abstract = {Statistical thinking in wildlife biology and ecology has been profoundly influenced by the introduction of AIC (Akaike's information criterion) as a tool for model selection and as a basis for model averaging. In this paper, we advocate the Bayesian paradigm as a broader framework for multimodel inference, one in which model averaging and model selection are naturally linked, and in which the performance of AIC-based tools is naturally evaluated. Prior model weights implicitly associated with the use of AIC are seen to highly favor complex models: in some cases, all but the most highly parameterized models in the model set are virtually ignored a priori. We suggest the usefulness of the weighted BIC (Bayesian information criterion) as a computationally simple alternative to AIC, based on explicit selection of prior model probabilities rather than acceptance of default priors associated with AIC. We note, however, that both procedures are only approximate to the use of exact Bayes factors. We discuss and illustrate technical difficulties associated with Bayes factors, and suggest approaches to avoiding these difficulties in the context of model selection for a logistic regression. Our example highlights the predisposition of AIC weighting to favor complex models and suggests a need for caution in using the BIC for computing approximate posterior model weights.},

abstract = {Deterministic niche-based processes have been proposed to explain species relative abundance within communities but lead to different predictions: habitat filtering (HF) predicts dominant species to exhibit similar traits while niche differentiation (ND) requires that species have dissimilar traits to coexist. Using a multiple trait-based approach, we evaluated the relative roles of HF and ND in determining species abundances in productive grasslands. Four dimensions of the functional niche of 12 co-occurring grass species were identified using 28 plant functional traits. Using this description of the species niche, we investigated patterns of functional similarity and dissimilarity and linked them to abundance in randomly assembled six-species communities subjected to fertilization/disturbance treatments. Our results suggest that HF and ND jointly determined species abundance by acting on contrasting niche dimensions. The effect of HF decreased relative to ND with increasing disturbance and decreasing fertilization. Dominant species exhibited similar traits in communities whereas dissimilarity favored the coexistence of rare species with dominants by decreasing inter-specific competition. This stabilizing effect on diversity was suggested by a negative relationship between species over-yielding and relative abundance. We discuss the importance of considering independent dimensions of functional niche to better understand species abundance and coexistence within communities.},

abstract = {Plant latex and other exudates are saps that are exuded from the points of plant damage caused either mechanically or by insect herbivory. Although many (ca. 10{\%}) of plant species exude latex or exudates, and although the defensive roles of plant latex against herbivorous insects have long been suggested by several studies, the detailed roles and functions of various latex ingredients, proteins and chemicals, in anti-herbivore plant defenses have not been well documented despite the wide occurrence of latex in the plant kingdom. Recently, however, substantial progress has been made. Several latex proteins, including cysteine proteases and chitin-related proteins, have been shown to play important defensive roles against insect herbivory. In the mulberry (Morus spp.)-silkworm (Bombyx mori) interaction, an old and well-known model system of plant-insect interaction, plant latex and its ingredients--sugar-mimic alkaloids and defense protein MLX56--are found to play key roles. Complicated molecular interactions between Apocynaceae species and its specialist herbivores, in which cardenolides and defense proteins in latex play key roles, are becoming more and more evident. Emerging observations suggested that plant latex, analogous to animal venom, is a treasury of useful defense proteins and chemicals that has evolved through interspecific interactions. On the other hand, specialist herbivores developed sophisticated adaptations, either molecular, physiological, or behavioral, against latex-borne defenses. The existence of various adaptations in specialist herbivores itself is evidence that latex and its ingredients function as defenses at least against generalists. Here, we review molecular and structural mechanisms, ecological roles, and evolutionary aspects of plant latex as a general defense against insect herbivory and we discuss, from recent studies, the unique characteristics of latex-borne defense systems as transport systems of defense substances are discussed based on recent studies.},

abstract = {Traditional conservation biology regards environmental fluctuations as detrimental to persistence, reducing long-term average growth rates and increasing the probability of extinction. By contrast, coexistence models from community ecology suggest that for species with dormancy, environmental fluctuations may be essential for persistence in competitive communities. We used models based on California grasslands to examine the influence of interannual fluctuations in the environment on the persistence of rare forbs competing with exotic grasses. Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation, a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all benefited the forb. In addition, the litter produced by grasses in a previously favorable year benefited forb persistence by inhibiting its germination into highly competitive grass environments. We conclude that contrary to conventional predictions of conservation and population biology, yearly fluctuations in climate may be essential for the persistence of rare species in invaded habitats.},

abstract = {Human activities have increased N availability dramatically in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of {\textgreater}900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from {\textgreater}60{\%} for the rarest species to 10{\%} for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance. Whereas abundance was consistently important across all systems, functional mechanisms were often system-dependent. As N availability continues to increase globally, management that focuses on locally susceptible functional groups and generally susceptible rare species will be essential to maintain biodiversity.},

abstract = {Determining differences between common and rare species is commonly used to identify factors responsible for rarity. Existing studies, however, suffer from two important drawbacks. First, studies compare species that are closely related phylogenetically but occupy different habitats. Second, these studies concentrate on single life history traits, with unknown relevance for population growth rates. Complete life cycles of one rare and one common Cirsium species sharing the same habitat were compared. Population growth rate was slightly lower in the rare species, translating into a large difference in local extinction probability. Seed predation intensity did not differ between species. However, it can be demonstrated that in connection with the data on complete demography, seed predation is the key factor causing a lower population growth rate in the rare species. These results are the first estimation of factors responsible for commonness or rarity of plants in terms of population growth rate without confounding differences in ecology. They demonstrate that conclusions based on single traits may be misleading and that only a comparison based on a complete life cycle can provide unequivocal evidence for concluding which factors are really those responsible for species commonness or rarity.},

abstract = {Examines 4 categories of biological mechanisms of determinants which cause and maintain species diversity: niche relations, habitat diversity, and 2 original determinants, mass effect (the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining) and ecological equivalency (the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements). The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transitions between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all 4 biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales.-from Authors},

abstract = {Questions: To what extent are small-scale ({\textless}200 m2) plant species dynamics related to biotic (species richness, proportion of short-lived species) and abiotic (soil nitrogen and moisture) factors? Are species-rich plant communities more stable in terms of their species composition? Do species-rich communities exhibit more variation in the number of individuals at both the population and community level? Locations: Coastal dunes, peatlands and marshlands, western Netherlands. Methods: We analysed small-scale species dynamics in naturally assembled plant communities from dune grassland, dune scrubland, dune slack, moist oligotrophic grassland and marshland, differing in species richness, soil nutrient and hydrological conditions. The analysis was based on long-term data sets comprising 61 permanent plots (scale: 2 x 2 m-14 x 14 m), monitored over a period of 14-52 yr, encompassing 992 relev{\'{e}}s. Species dynamics was expressed using different measures, i.e. species turnover, species dissimilarity, cumulative species number and variation in species abundances, at the population and community level. Plot size and length of the monitoring period were included as explanatory variables to make clear that the results were not confounded by these factors. Results: Generalized linear modelling revealed that the variation in species dynamics among plots was largely explained by biotic factors, i.e. differences in species diversity (19-54{\%}) and the proportion of short-lived species in the vegetation ({\textless}3{\%}), and to a small extent ({\textless}10{\%}) by abiotic factors, i.e. differences in abiotic conditions. Species-rich plots were more stable in terms of species composition and year-to-year variation in species abundances and total species abundances. Conclusions: The naturally assembled communities, spanning a broad gradient of resource availability (dry to moist and nutrient-poor to -rich soils), conformed to the same positive relationship between diversity and stability, both at the population and the community level. Although observational studies do not allow drawing of conclusions on mechanisms behind observed patterns, possible explanations are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {The effects of habitat fragmentation and their implications for biodiversity is a central issue in conservation biology which still lacks an overall comprehension. There is not yet a clear consensus on how to quantify fragmentation even though it is quite common to couple the effects of habitat loss with habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Here we address the spatial patterns of species distribution in fragmented landscapes, assuming a neutral community model. To build up the fragmented landscapes, we employ the fractional Brownian motion approach, which in turn permits us to tune the amount of habitat loss and degree of clumping of the landscape independently. The coupling between the neutral community model, here simulated by means of the coalescent method, and fractal neutral landscape models enables us to address how the species-area relationship changes as the spatial patterns of a landscape is varied. The species-area relationship is one of the most fundamental laws in ecology, considered as a central tool in conservation biology, and is used to predict species loss following habitat disturbances. Our simulation results indicate that the level of clumping has a major role in shaping the species-area relationship. For instance, more compact landscapes are more sensitive to the effects of habitat loss and speciation rate. Besides, the level of clumping determines the existence and extension of the power-law regime which is expected to hold at intermediate scales. The distributions of species abundance are strongly influenced by the degree of fragmentation. We also show that the first and second commonest species have approximately self-similar spatial distributions across scales, with the fractal dimensions of the support of the first and second commonest species being very robust to changes in the spatial patterns of the landscape.},

abstract = {Topography is recognized as an important factor in controlling plant distribution and diversity patterns, but its scale dependence and the underlying mechanisms by which it operates are not well understood. Here, we used novel high-resolution (2-m scale) topographic data from more than 30500 vegetation plots to assess the importance of topography for local plant diversity and distribution patterns across Denmark, a 43000 km2 lowland region. The vegetation data came from 901 nature conservation sites (mean size 1/4 0.16 km2) distributed throughout Denmark, each having an average of 34 plots (five-meter radius) per site. We employed a variety of statistical measures and techniques to investigate scale dependence and mechanistic drivers operating within the study region. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression modeling scaled at different spatial resolutions (232, 10310, 50350, 1003100 and 2503 250 m) was used to identify the horizontal resolution yielding the strongest vegetation-topography relationships. Using data scaled at this resolution, we quantified local (within-site) and regional (among sites) relationships between elevation, mechanistic topographic factors (slope, heat index, potential solar radiation, wind exposure, wetness index) and 10 vegetation measures representing species composition, richness and functional composition (average plant preferences along key environmental niche axes). We also investigated how overall site-level environmental characteristics affect the strength of these local relationships. Topography exerted the strongest effects at the 10 3 10 m horizontal resolution scale. Elevation exerted the strongest influence on vegetation, followed by slope and wetness. Topography generally affected all vegetation measures and exhibited the strongest local relationships with the main species-compositional gradient, the main functional gradient and the plant's average soil moisture preference. The strength of these relationships was strongly influenced by habitat and site-level average moisture conditions, with the strongest relationships found in wet habitats. Our findings show that finescale topography can strongly influence local vegetation patterns across a wide range of habitat types even in low-relief lowland regions. Notably, topography exhibited a consistently strong relationship with the main local floristic and functional compositional gradients. While a plurality of underlying mechanisms may contribute to the relationship between topography and vegetation patterns, topographically controlled soil moisture exerts primary control on the relationship. {\textcopyright} 2013 Moeslund et al.},

abstract = {AIM: Metacommunity theories attribute different relative degrees of importance to dispersal, environmental filtering, biotic interactions and stochastic processes in community assembly, but the role of spatial scale remains uncertain. Here we used two complementary statistical tools to test: (1) whether or not the patterns of community structure and environmental influences are consistent across resolutions; and (2) whether and how the joint use of two fundamentally different statistical approaches provides a complementary interpretation of results. LOCATION: Grassland plants in the French Alps. METHODS: We used two approaches across five spatial resolutions (ranging from 1 km × 1 km to 30 km × 30 km): variance partitioning, and analysis of metacommunity structure on the site-by-species incidence matrices. Both methods allow the testing of expected patterns resulting from environmental filtering, but variance partitioning allows the role of dispersal and environmental gradients to be studied, while analysis of the site-by-species metacommunity structure informs an understanding of how environmental filtering occurs and whether or not patterns differ from chance expectation. We also used spatial regressions on species richness to identify relevant environmental factors at each scale and to link results from the two approaches. RESULTS: Major environmental drivers of richness included growing degree-days, temperature, moisture and spatial or temporal heterogeneity. Variance partitioning pointed to an increase in the role of dispersal at coarser resolutions, while metacommunity structure analysis pointed to environmental filtering having an important role at all resolutions through a Clementsian assembly process (i.e. groups of species having similar range boundaries and co-occurring in similar environments). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The combination of methods used here allows a better understanding of the forces structuring ecological communities than either one of them used separately. A key aspect in this complementarity is that variance partitioning can detect effects of dispersal whereas metacommunity structure analysis cannot. Moreover, the latter can distinguish between different forms of environmental filtering (e.g. individualistic versus group species responses to environmental gradients).},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits mediate organisms' interactions with the environment and determine how they affect and are affected by their biotic and abiotic milieu. Thus, dispersion of trait values, or functional diversity (FD) of a community can offer insights into processes driving community assembly. For example, underdispersion of FD suggests that habitat "filtering" of species with unfavorable trait values restricts the species that can exist in a particular habitat, while even spacing of FD suggests that interspecific competition, or biotic "sorting," discourages the coexistence of species with similar trait values. Since assembly processes are expected to vary as a function of spatial scale, we should also expect patterns of FD to reflect scale dependence in filtering and biotic sorting. Here we present the concept of the functional-diversity-area relationship (FAR), which is similar to the species-area relationship but plots a measure of phenotypic trait diversity as a function of spatial scale. We develop a set of null model tests that discriminate between FARs generated predominantly by filtering or biotic sorting and indicate the scales at which these effects are pronounced. The utility of the FAR for addressing long-standing issues in ecology is illustrated with several examples. A multi-scale examination of FD and its pattern relative to null expectations provides an important tool for ecologists interested in understanding the scale dependence of community assembly processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Houseman2013,
abstract = {AimsSpecies aggregation is commonly seen in plant communities and may increase diversity by causing intraspecific competition to exceed interspecific competition. One potential source of this spatial aggregation is seed dispersal but it is unclear to what extent aggregated seed distributions affect plant diversity in real communities. Using a field experiment, I tested whether uniform or aggregated seed arrival alters community structure and whether these effects vary with sowing density.MethodsThe experiment consisted of two spatial seeding treatments (uniform and aggregated) that were fully crossed with three seed density treatments. Sixty, 3 × 4-m plots were arrayed in a low-diversity grassland located in Kansas, USA. Each plot was divided into forty-eight, 0.5 × 0.5-m patches. For aggregated seeding treatments, each of the 15 species was sown into three randomly selected patches within the plot (3×15 = 45). To create a uniform species arrival but control for the seed addition method, all 15 species were sown into 45 individual patches (with three patches remaining unsown) within each plot. Seed mass for each species was held constant at the plot scale between uniform or aggregated treatments within a given level of the sowing density treatment. After two growing seasons, plant density was quantified for all sown species in 15 randomly selected patches from each plot.Important FindingsI found evidence for shifts in community structure in response to the different spatial seeding patterns. The evenness of added species was higher under aggregated than uniform sowing patterns. There was no detectable effect of aggregated seed sowing on species richness at 3.75 m 2 scale. However, when species richness was extrapolated to larger scales (11.25 m2), aggregated sowing was predicted to have greater richness than uniform sowing. Effects of seed aggregation on community structure were apparent only at moderate to high sowing rates, yet the latter are within the range of measured seed dispersal in similar grasslands. Additionally, as sowing density increased, seed mass became an increasingly effective predictor of relative abundances for added species, but only under uniform sowing patterns supporting the idea that aggregated dispersal may buffer weaker (smaller seeded) species from competition during colonization. This is the first experiment to show that aggregated seed dispersal patterns can increase at least some components of plant diversity in undisturbed grasslands and suggests that previous seed dispersal experiments, which utilize uniform seed sowing, may underestimate the potential effect of dispersal on plant community structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

@article{Dauby2014,
abstract = {Aim: Our aim was to document African rain forest tree diversity patterns to test whether they support one of the following hypotheses: the structure of tree species diversity is at equilibrium and mostly driven by neutral processes (H0); the structure of tree species diversity results from Pleistocene forest cover dynamics (H1); or the structure of tree species diversity results from ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H2). Location: West Central Africa: the hilly region of Gabon, a putative Pleistocene forest refuge, and the adjacent flat littoral region, putatively colonized by forests from the hilly region after the last glaciation. Methods: We used 103 standardized 0.1-ha tree plots distributed among five landscapes in the two regions. We partitioned the tree diversity within and among plots at a local and regional scale using the Hurlbert effective number of species framework. The explanatory power of geographical and elevational distances on species turnover was tested. At the landscape scale, we partitioned the beta diversity into nestedness and turnover components. Results: Mean alpha and gamma diversities were much higher in the hilly region, where differences in elevation explained a significant part of species turnover. Substantial species turnover correlated with geographical distance also occurred in the littoral region despite its low elevational heterogeneity. Floristic turnover between plots from different regions remained stable whatever the elevational/geographical distances. At the regional scale, species replacement remained the main contributor to beta diversity (low nestedness values). Main conclusions: The heterogeneous distribution of alpha and gamma diversity, similar levels of species turnover among plots and the low contribution of the nestedness component to beta diversity between hilly and littoral landscapes do not support hypotheses H0 and H1. The combined impacts of limited dispersal and ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H2) can explain patterns within regions. The marked floristic discontinuity between regions could reflect contrasting histories (two distinct refugia) although the role of contrasting environments cannot be discounted. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Species abundances are undoubtedly the most widely available macroecological data, but can we use them to distinguish among several models of community structure? Here we present a Bayesian analysis of species-abundance data that yields a full joint probability distribution of each model's parameters plus a relatively parameter-independent criterion, the posterior Bayes factor, to compare these models. We illustrate our approach by comparing three classical distributions: the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) distribution, based on Hubbell's neutral model, the multivariate Poisson lognormal distribution (MPLN), based on niche arguments, and the discrete broken stick (DBS) distribution, based on MacArthur's broken stick model. We give explicit formulas for the probability of observing a particular species-abundance data set in each model, and argue that conditioning on both sample size and species count is needed to allow comparisons between the two distributions. We apply our approach to two neotropical communities (trees, fish). We find that DBS is largely inferior to ZSM and MPLN for both communities. The tree data do not allow discrimination between ZSM and MPLN, but for the fish data ZSM (neutral model) overwhelmingly outperforms MPLN (niche model), suggesting that dispersal plays a previously underestimated role in structuring tropical freshwater fish communities. We advocate this approach for identifying the relative importance of dispersal and niche-partitioning in determining diversity of different ecological groups of species under different environmental conditions.},

abstract = {In the context of neutral theories of community ecology, a novel genealogy-based framework has recently furnished an analytic extension of Ewens' sampling multivariate abundance distribution, which also applies to a random sample from a local community. Here, instead of taking a multivariate approach, we further develop the sampling theory of Hubbell's neutral spatially implicit theory and derive simple abundance distributions for a random sample both from a local community and a metacommunity. Our result is given in terms of the average number of species with a given abundance in any randomly extracted sample. Contrary to what has been widely assumed, a random sample from a metacommunity is not fully described by the Fisher log-series, but by a new distribution. This new sample distribution matches the log-series expectation at high biodiversity values ($\theta$ {\textgreater} 1) but clearly departs from it for species-poor metacommunities ($\theta$ {\textless} 1). Our theoretical framework should be helpful in the better assessment of diversity and testing of the neutral theory by using abundance data.},

abstract = {Published in 2001, The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) emphasizes the importance of stochastic processes in ecological community structure, and has challenged the traditional niche-based view of ecology. While neutral models have since been applied to a broad range of ecological and macroecological phenomena, the majority of research relating to neutral theory has focused exclusively on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Here, we synthesize the large body of work on neutral theory in the context of the species abundance distribution, with a particular focus on integrating ideas from neutral theory with traditional niche theory. First, we summarize the basic tenets of neutral theory; both in general and in the context of SADs. Second, we explore the issues associated with neutral theory and the SAD, such as complications with fitting and model comparison, the underlying assumptions of neutral models, and the difficultly of linking pattern to process. Third, we highlight the advances in understanding of SADs that have resulted from neutral theory and models. Finally, we focus consideration on recent developments aimed at unifying neutral- and niche-based approaches to ecology, with a particular emphasis on what this means for SAD theory, embracing, for instance, ideas of emergent neutrality and stochastic niche theory. We put forward the argument that the prospect of the unification of niche and neutral perspectives represents one of the most promising future avenues of neutral theory research. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis were among the first statistical methods employed to extract information from genetic markers. From their early applications to current innovations, these approaches have proven to be efficient for the analysis of the genetic variability in various contexts such as human genetics, conservation and adaptation studies. However, because multivariate analysis is a wide and diversified area of statistics, choosing a method appropriate to both the data and to the question being asked can be difficult. Moreover, some particularities of genetic markers need to be taken into account when using multivariate methods. As a consequence, multivariate analyses are often used as black boxes, which results in frequent mistakes in the literature. In this review, we provide a critical analysis of the application of multivariate methods to genetic markers, using a general framework that unifies all these methods for the sake of clarity. First, we focus on some common mistakes in these applications and ways to avoid these pitfalls. We then detail the most critical particularities of allele frequencies that demand adaptations of multivariate methods, and we propose solutions to the subsequent problems. Finally, we tackle several questions of interest in which multivariate analysis has a great role to play, such as the study of the typological coherence of different genetic markers, or the investigation of spatial genetic patterns.},

abstract = {Integration of evidence over the past decade has revised understandings about the major adaptations underlying the origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Many features associated with Homo sapiens, including our large linear bodies, elongated hind limbs, large energy-expensive brains, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits, were once thought to have evolved near the origin of the genus in response to heightened aridity and open habitats in Africa. However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From {\~{}}2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early Homo evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales. These contexts gave a selective advantage to traits, such as dietary flexibility and larger body size, that facilitated survival in shifting environments.},

@article{Orrock2010,
abstract = {The outcome of competitive interactions is likely to be influenced by both competitive dominance (i.e. niche-based dynamics) and ecological drift (i.e. neutral dynamics governed by demographic stochasticity). However, spatial models of competition rarely consider the joint operation of these two processes. We develop a model based on the original competition-colonization trade-off model that incorporates niche and neutral processes and several realistic facets of ecological dynamics: it allows local competition (i.e. competition within a patch) to occur within communities of a finite size, it allows competitors to vary in the degree of competitive asymmetry, and it includes the role of local migration (i.e. propagule pressure). The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e.g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt.},

abstract = {Resolving contingencies in community ecology requires comparative studies of local communities along broad-scale environmental gradients and in different biogeographic regions. However, comparisons of local ecological processes among regions require a synthetic understanding of how the species pool of potential community members influences the structure of ecological communities. Here, we outline an integrative approach for quantifying local ecological processes while explicitly accounting for species pool influences. Specifically, we highlight the utility of combining geographically replicated local studies, null models of community structure, and ecologically explicit definitions of the species pool as a means to compare predominant ecological processes among regions. By uniting concepts and tools from community ecology and macroecology, this approach might facilitate synthesis and resolve many perceived ecological contingencies.},

@article{Swenson2007,
abstract = {The relative importance of biotic, abiotic, and stochastic processes in structuring ecological communities continues to be a central focus in community ecology. In order to assess the role of phylogenetic relatedness on the nature of biodiversity we first quantified the degree of phylogenetic niche conservatism of several plant traits linked to plant form and function. Next we quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness across two fundamental scaling dimensions: plant size and neighborhood size. The results show that phylogenetic niche conservatism is likely widespread, indicating that closely related species are more functionally similar than distantly related species. Utilizing this information we show that three of five tropical forest dynamics plots (FDPs) exhibit similar scale-dependent patterns of phylogenetic structuring using only a spatial scaling axis. When spatial- and size-scaling axes were analyzed in concert, phylogenetic overdispersion of co-occurring species was most important at small spatial scales and in four of five FDPs for the largest size class. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness is increasingly important: (1) at small spatial scales, where phylogenetic overdispersion is more common, and (2) in large size classes, where phylogenetic overdispersion becomes more common throughout ontogeny. Collectively, our results highlight the critical spatial and size scales at which the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between constituent species influences the structuring of tropical forest diversity.},

abstract = {The extent to which biodiversity change in local assemblages contributes to global biodiversity loss is poorly understood. We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal $\alpha$ diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal $\beta$ diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are renowned for their biological diversity, but also harbor variable combinations of soil age, chemistry and susceptibility to erosion or tectonic uplift. Here we contend that the combined effects of this biotic and abiotic diversity promote exceptional biogeochemical heterogeneity at multiple scales. At local levels, high plant diversity creates variation in chemical and structural traits that affect plant production, decomposition and nutrient cycling. At regional levels, myriad combinations of soil age, soil chemistry and landscape dynamics create variation and uncertainty in limiting nutrients that do not exist at higher latitudes. The effects of such heterogeneity are not well captured in large-scale estimates of tropical ecosystem function, but we suggest new developments in remote sensing can help bridge the gap.},

Some of these methods are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas others are recent, including the methods of temporal eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration (i.e. addressing several scales of variation) of univariate or multivariate response data, reviewed, to our knowledge for the first time in this review. These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space-time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix.},

@article{Hernandez-Stefanoni2006,
abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial distribution of plant species is essential to conservation and forest managers in order to identify high priority areas such as vulnerable species and habitats, and designate areas for reserves, refuges and other protected areas. A reliable map of the diversity of plant species over the landscape is an invaluable tool for such purposes. In this study, the number of species, the exponent Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson indices, calculated from 141 quadrat sites sampled in a tropical forest were used to compare the performance of several spatial interpolation techniques used to prepare a map of plant diversity, starting from sample (point) data over the landscape. Means of mapped classes, inverse distance functions, kriging and co-kriging, both, applied over the entire studied landscape and also applied within vegetation classes, were the procedures compared. Significant differences in plant diversity indices between classes demonstrated the usefulness of boundaries between vegetation types, mapped through satellite image classification, in stratifying the variability of plant diversity over the landscape. These mapped classes, improved the accuracy of the interpolation methods when they were used as prior information for stratification of the area. Spatial interpolation by co-kriging performed among the poorest interpolators due to the poor correlation between the plant diversity variables and vegetation indices computed by remote sensing and used as covariables. This indicated that the latter are not suitable covariates of plant diversity indices. Finally, a within-class kriging interpolator yielded the most accurate estimates of plant diversity values. This interpolator not only provided the most accurate estimates by accounting for the indices' intra-class variability, but also provided additional useful interpretations of the structure of spatial variability of diversity values through the interpretation of their semi-variograms. This additional role was found very useful in aiding decisions in conservation planning.},

However, we believe that some of his accompanying arguments for the primacy of such work and, in particular, for the need to "disintegrate" the local community concept are flawed. We revisit Ricklefs's main tenets and demonstrate that research on local communities is a vital part of understanding processes and diversity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The integration of research across spatial scales expands our horizons and understanding of ecology and evolution, and this should not be unnecessarily constrained to one extreme or the other.},

Conclusions and outlook 21 Acknowledgements 22 References 22 Summary It is the aim of this review to present a monographic survey of the neotropical genus Clusia on scaling levels from molecular phylogeny, metabolism, photosynthesis and autecological environmental responses to ecological amplitude and synecological habitat impact. Clusia is the only dicotyledonous genus with real trees performing crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). By way of introduction, a brief historical reminiscence describes the discovery of CAM in Clusia and the consequent increase in interest in studying this particular genus of tropical shrubs and trees. The molecular phylogeny of CAM in the genus is compared with that in Kalancho{\"{e}} and the Bromeliaceae. At the level of metabolism and photosynthesis, the great plasticity of expression of photosynthetic physiotypes, i.e. (i) C(3) photosynthesis, (ii) CAM including CAM idling, (iii) CAM cycling and (iv) C(3)/CAM-intermediate behaviour, as well as metabolic flexibility in Clusia is illustrated. At the level of autecology, the factors water, irradiance and temperature, which control photosynthetic flexibility, are assessed. The phenotypic plasticity of physiotypes and morphotypes is described. At the level of synecology, the ecological amplitude of Clusia in the tropics and the relations to habitat are surveyed.},

abstract = {As rates of deforestation continue to rise in many parts of the tropics, the international conservation community is faced with the challenge of finding approaches which can reduce deforestation and provide rural livelihoods in addition to conserving biodiversity. Much of modern-day conservation is motivated by a desire to conserve 'pristine nature' in protected areas, while there is growing recognition of the long-term human involvement in forest dynamics and of the importance of conservation outside protected areas. Agroforestry -- intentional management of shade trees with agricultural crops -- has the potential for providing habitats outside formally protected land, connecting nature reserves and alleviating resource-use pressure on conservation areas. Here we examine the role of agroforestry systems in maintaining species diversity and conclude that these systems can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes.},

abstract = {The Mantel correlogram is an elegant way to compute a correlogram for multivariate data. However, recent papers raised concerns about the power of the Mantel test itself. Hence the question: Is the Mantel correlogram powerful enough to be useful? To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms. We conclude that the Mantel correlogram deserves its place in the ecologist's toolbox.},

abstract = {Taxa co-occurring in communities often represent a nonrandom sample, in phenotypic or phylogenetic terms, of the regional species pool. While heuristic arguments have identified processes that create community phylogenetic patterns, further progress hinges on a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. We created a simulation framework to model trait evolution, assemble communities (via competition, habitat filtering, or neutral assembly), and test the phylogenetic pattern of the resulting communities. We found that phylogenetic community structure is greatest when traits are highly conserved and when multiple traits influence species membership in communities. Habitat filtering produces stronger phylogenetic structure when taxa with derived (as opposed to ancestral) traits are favored in the community. Nearest-relative tests have greater power to detect patterns due to competition, while total community relatedness tests perform better with habitat filtering. The size of the local community relative to the regional pool strongly influences statistical power; in general, power increases with larger pool sizes for communities created by filtering but decreases for communities created by competition. Our results deepen our understanding of processes that contribute to phylogenetic community structure and provide guidance for the design and interpretation of empirical research.},

abstract = {Predictive models of plant diversity have typically focused on either a landscape's capacity for richness (equilibrium models), or on the processes that regulate competitive exclusion, and thus allow species to coexist (nonequilibrium models). Here, we review the concepts and purposes of a hierarchical, multiscale model of the controls of plant diversity that incorporates the equilibrium model of climatic favorability at macroscales, nonequilibrium models of competition at microscales, and a mixed model emphasizing environmental heterogeneity at mesoscales. We evaluate the conceptual model using published data from three spatially nested datasets: (1) a macroscale analysis of ecoregions in the continental and western U.S.; (2) a mesoscale study in California; and (3) a microscale study in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and California. At the macroscale (areas from 3889 km2 to 638,300 km2), climate (actual evaporation) was a strong predictor of tree diversity (R2 = 0.80), as predicted by the conceptual model, but area was a better predictor for vascular plant diversity overall (R2 = 0.38), which suggests different types of plants differ in their sensitivity to climatic controls. At mesoscales (areas from 1111 km2 to 15,833 km2), climate was still an important predictor of richness (R2 = 0.52), but, as expected, topographic heterogeneity explained an important share of the variance (R2 = 0.19) showed positive correlations with diversity of trees, shrubs, and annual and perennial herbs, and was the primary predictor of shrub and annual plant species richness. At microscales (0.1 ha plots), spatial patterns of diversity showed a clear unimodal pattern along a climate-driven productivity gradient and a negative relationship with soil fertility. The strong decline in understory and total diversity at the most productive sites suggests that competitive controls, as predicted, can override climatic controls at this scale. We conclude that this hierarchical, multiscale model provides a sound basis to understand and analyze plant species diversity. Specifically, future research should employ the principles in this paper to explore climatic controls on species richness of different life forms, better quantify environmental heterogeneity in landscapes, and analyze how these large-scale factors interact with local nonequilibrium dynamics to maintain plant diversity.},

@article{McIntire2013,
abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. References SUMMARY: Models describing the biotic drivers that create and maintain biological diversity within trophic levels have focused primarily on negative interactions (i.e. competition), leaving marginal room for positive interactions (i.e. facilitation). We show facilitation to be a ubiquitous driver of biodiversity by first noting that all species use resources and thus change the local biotic or abiotic conditions, altering the available multidimensional niches. This can cause a shift in local species composition, which can cause an increase in beta, and sometimes alpha, diversity. We show that these increases are ubiquitous across ecosystems. These positive effects on diversity occur via a broad host of disparate direct and indirect mechanisms. We identify and unify several of these facilitative mechanisms and discuss why it has been easy to underappreciate the importance of facilitation. We show that net positive effects have a long history of being considered ecologically or evolutionarily unstable, and we present recent evidence of its potential stability. Facilitation goes well beyond the common case of stress amelioration and it probably gains importance as community complexity increases. While biodiversity is, in part, created by species exploiting many niches, many niches are available to exploit only because species create them.},

abstract = {The Mantel test is widely used to test the linear or monotonic independence of the elements in two distance matrices. It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular, the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum-of-squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables, the power of linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms, meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore, the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances.},

abstract = {Statistical methods emphasizing formal hypothesis testing have dominated the analyses used by ecologists to gain insight from data. Here, we review alternatives to hypothesis testing including techniques for parameter estimation and model selection using likelihood and Bayesian techniques. These methods emphasize evaluation of weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses, multimodel inference, and use of prior information in analysis. We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies. These statistical methods hold promise for new insight in ecology by encouraging thoughtful model building as part of inquiry, providing a unified framework for the empirical analysis of theoretical models, and by facilitating the formal accumulation of evidence bearing on fundamental questions.},

@article{Laliberte2009,
abstract = {Niche processes and other spatial processes, such as dispersal, may simultaneously control beta diversity, yet their relative importance may shift across spatial and temporal scales. Although disentangling the relative importance of these processes has been a continuing methodological challenge, recent developments in multi-scale spatial and temporal modeling can now help ecologists estimate their scale-specific contributions. Here we present a statistical approach to (1) detect the presence of a space-time interaction on community composition and (2) estimate the scale-specific importance of environmental and spatial factors on beta diversity. To illustrate the applicability of this approach, we use a case study from a temperate forest understory where tree seedling abundances were monitored during a 9-year period at 40 permanent plots. We found no significant space-time interaction on tree seedling composition, which means that the spatial abundance patterns did not vary over the study period. However, for a given year the relative importance of niche processes and other spatial processes was found to be scale-specific. Tree seedling abundances were primarily controlled by a broad-scale environmental gradient, but within the confines of this gradient the finer scale patchiness was largely due to other spatial processes. This case study illustrates that these two sets of processes are not mutually exclusive and can affect abundance patterns in a scale-dependent manner. More importantly, the use of our methodology for future empirical studies should help in the merging of niche and neutral perspectives on beta diversity, an obvious next step for community ecology.},

abstract = {Functional trait differences among species are increasingly used to infer the effects of biotic and abiotic processes on species coexistence. Commonly, the trait diversity observed within communities is compared to patterns simulated in randomly generated communities based on sampling within a region. The resulting patterns of trait convergence and divergence are assumed to reveal abiotic and biotic processes, respectively. However, biotic processes such as competition can produce both trait divergence and convergence, through either excluding similar species (niche differences, divergence) or excluding dissimilar species (weaker competitor exclusion, convergence). Hence, separating biotic and abiotic processes that can produce identical patterns of trait diversity, or even patterns that neutralize each other, is not feasible with previous methods. We propose an operational framework in which the functional trait dissimilarity within communities (FDcomm) is compared to the corresponding trait dissimilarity expected from the species pool (i.e., functional species pool diversity, FDpool). FDpool includes the set of potential species for a site delimited by the operating environmental and dispersal limitation filters. By applying these filters, the resulting pattern of trait diversity is consistent with biotic processes, i.e., trait divergence (FDcomm {\textgreater} FDpool) indicates niche differentiation, while trait convergence (FDcomm {\textless} FDpool) indicates weaker competitor exclusion. To illustrate this framework, with its potential application and constraints, we analyzed both simulated and field data. The functional species pool framework more consistently detected the simulated trait diversity patterns than previous approaches. In the field, using data from plant communities of typical Northern European habitats in Estonia, we found that both niche-based and weaker competitor exclusion influenced community assembly, depending on the traits and community considered. In both simulated and field data, we demonstrated that only by estimating the species pool of a site is it possible to differentiate the patterns of trait dissimilarity produced by operating biotic processes. The framework, which can be applied with both functional and phylogenetic diversity, enables a reinterpretation of community assembly processes. Solving the challenge of defining an appropriate reference species pool for a site can provide a better understanding of community assembly.},

Twenty years of intense theoretical and empirical research have shown that such biotic impoverishment can markedly alter the biogeochemical and dynamic properties of ecosystems, but frontiers remain in linking this research to the complexity of wild nature, and in applying it to pressing environmental issues such as food, water, energy, and biosecurity. The question before us is whether these advances can take us beyond merely invoking the precautionary principle of conserving biodiversity to a predictive science that informs practical and specific solutions to mitigate and adapt to its loss.},

abstract = {Natural populations consist of phenotypically diverse individuals that exhibit variation in their demographic parameters and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Recent experimental work indicates that such variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate? Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution.},

abstract = {How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reflect evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.},

Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities.},

abstract = {Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

The quality of a paper's research content is judged by originality, importance and scientific validity. Advice should be sought on a project's potential for high-quality research content before taking up the research. When readers have difficulties in understanding a paper, the problem more often lies with presentation and structure than with its scientific content. Readers expect information to be presented in a certain way and when this does not happen they may misinterpret what the writer intended.},

abstract = {There are many varieties of medical writing. This paper suggests a sound, practical approach for writing up a research project in the conventional format for a medical or scientific journal. The structure of a scientific paper is well established, to accommodate the "Why" of the project (the Introduction), the "Who, when, where and how" (the Methods) and the "What" (the Results). The Discussion (the "So what") should be in three parts--discussion and explanation of results, disputation, and disquisition (implications for practice and for future work). Guidelines are given for getting started and for producing a paper that will, hopefully, be published and read.},

To assure social work instructors that writing instruction, like writing, is no mysterious and impossible chore, this article introduces three key concepts of composition theory: writing to learn, writing as process, and writing as social act. To demonstrate the interrelated ap- plications of these concepts, various uses of classroom journals are presented. Further, instructors are encouraged to require multiple drafts of papers and to provide written assignment guides. Some suggestions for useful commenting on drafts are provided.},

@article{Devine2001,
abstract = {Whole article, actually The experts agree: "Publish or Perish" is still alive and well in the research community. "The cardinal rule is, 'A scientific experiment is not complete until the results have been published,'" notes Bob Day, professor emeritus, department of English, University of Delaware, and author of a book on scientific paper publishing.1 In addition to "completing an experiment," publication in scientific literature serves as a means to secure knowledge ownership claims and is an efficient vehicle for communicating this knowledge.2 Bruce Lewenstein, associate professor of communication and science and technology studies, Cornell University, expounds, "Scientific knowledge is a communal resource that only exists because it's available for others to judge and affirm as important." Other experts have a more pragmatic perspective. "Researchers publish for economic self-interest, ... it provides visibility and is evidence of productivity," comments Ed Huth, editor emeritus of the Annals of Internal Medicine and author of a book on publishing in medicine.3 Jeremy Flower-Ellis, associate professor, department for production ecology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, who has taught a course on how to write and publish a scientific paper since 1968, succinctly agrees, "No publications, no funds; no funds, no job." Lewenstein, who is also editor of the journal, Public Understanding of Science, says it is important to recognize that scientists are individuals in a large system, with personal, less altruistic reasons for publishing. He explains that publishing is the means by which a scientist can be rewarded. Those rewards can include recognition for ideas; others seeking the author out for collaboration; invitations to meetings to talk about ideas and thus, stay intellectually alive; invitations to meetings at locations that are personally pleasurable; recognition from deans and department heads regarding the value of the researcher's work in the form of increased resources (i.e., lab space and graduate students); and higher salary from those same deans and directors when another institution tries to hire the scientist because they value the work they see published. Not All Journals Are Created Equal This pressure to publish and the limited number of pages in existing journals has contributed to a proliferation of journals, notes Lewenstein. He adds that while there are an estimated 70,000 journals, only a few thousand are considered really important. Jeff Skousen, professor of soil science, West Virginia University, points out that there are varying levels of journal prestige and not every paper qualifies for the most well-known. Top-tier journals usually reject more than 50 percent of the papers submitted to them, and some have rejection rates as high as 70 percent, Skousen says. These journals are rigorously edited and require very sound science and results that have meaning and application in the field. Other journals have a much lower rejection rate and are not as tightly edited, but they generally contain good research. Third-tier journals rarely reject a paper unless the entire study is flawed or the data is improperly interpreted. These journals are also acceptable because they generally answer real questions and report good science, but they often do not account for all the variables required for a top-tier journal. Huth agrees that as the prestige of journals goes down, the tendency to publish whatever is legitimate goes up. "The most prestigious journals tend to publish what is the most important in new work," he notes. Flower-Ellis also affirms, "A paper rejected by one journal may be slightly rehashed and submitted to another, then another, and so on, until it eventually is accepted by a journal with a sufficiently low threshold. Thus, because of the numerous journals available, and the varying prestige, most people can publish their work at some tier level." Huth points out that there may be a trade-off to consider between how important it is to publish rapidly and get results on the record versus how important it is to publish in the most prestigious journal possible. In addition to journal prestige, the author's track record can also be a factor in publishing success. Day says, "Editors are human and, therefore, they can be affected by past work and influenced by a name they recognize." Presumably, "that is why ... many papers include the names of established scientists among their authors even when the established names may have contributed little to the work," remarks Flower-Ellis. Experience gained from previous publishing helps as well. According to Skousen, "Scientists who publish know some of the pitfalls and obstacles that hinder the publishing process, especially in the top-tier journals." Daniel W. Byrne, director of biostatistics and study design, general clinical research center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, however, believes it probably does not improve the odds of acceptance very much. Instead, says Bryne, who has authored a book on publishing medical research papers,4 once a person has developed the skills to publish a paper, the next papers are much easier to publish. Criteria for Authors While originality can be a persuasive factor, "People are still able to get their work published even if it seems similar to previously published work," observes Skousen. Although one may think that most of the pertinent questions in a subject area might be answered after long periods of testing and experimentation that does not seem to be the case, he continues. "I'm surprised that there are not that many new ideas in our journals today compared to past decades," he remarks. "Sure, we get new instruments and tools that allow greater precision or accuracy of measurement, but the ideas are not that dissimilar, nor are the results that dissimilar after data collection and interpretation." Flower-Ellis predicts that more and more papers will be assessed as "valuable confirmations" rather than as "original contributions to knowledge." Another consideration is the manuscript topic. A hot topic "is more likely to be published than is an equally sound paper dealing with a currently unfashionable subject," says Flower-Ellis The scientific community does display some of the proverbial characteristics of lemmings, in publication no less than in choice of research area." The criteria publishers use as measures for accepting a paper varies a lot more than is sometimes realized, notes Lewenstein. Publication is not a cut-and-dried process-it's infinitely variable and flexible. In particular, "peer review" is not a simple criterion, he continues. Some journals may send an article to three to five reviewers, and the editors make an informed judgment by weighing all reviews. Other journals may send an article to a single reviewer and make simple yes/no decisions based on one review. Some journals may do a lot more editorial work with an author, while others take manuscripts more or less as submitted. Although the review process can be flexible, acceptance criteria are relatively standard. Experts consulted offer simple advice for optimizing publishing success. Many say influential factors include the need for clarity, originality of thought, novelty of finding, organization, completeness, and good writing. The experts' advice may seem evident. Skousen, however, states that the most elegant research is usually simple and direct. According to Byrne, who published an article last year on common reasons for manuscript rejection,5 flawed or poorly planned study design and lack of detail in methods were the two elements most often leading to rejection. One life science researcher with an impressive publication history (71 papers over 20 years with 50 of those papers since becoming a faculty member in 1993) is M. Celeste Simon, a University of Pennsylvania associate professor in cell and developmental biology. A Howard Hughes Medical Institute associate investigator at Penn's Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Simon's philosophy is one for all researchers to consider, "Publishing is the currency in which researchers deal."

abstract = {The concepts of niche conservatism and adaptive radiation have played central roles in the study of evolution and ecological diversification. With respect to phenotypic evolution, the two processes may be seen as opposite ends of a spectrum; however, there is no straightforward method for the comparative analysis of trait evolution that will identify these contrasting scenarios. Analysis of the rate of phenotypic evolution plays an important role in this context and merits increased attention. In this article, independent contrasts are used to estimate rates of evolution for continuous traits under a Brownian motion model of evolution. A unit for the rate of phenotypic diversification is introduced: the felsen, in honor of J. Felsenstein, is defined as an increase of one unit per million years in the variance among sister taxa of ln-transformed trait values. The use of a standardized unit of measurement facilitates comparisons among clades and traits. Rates of diversification of three functional traits (plant height, leaf size, and seed size) were estimated for four to six woody plant clades (Acer, Aesculus, Ceanothus, Arbutoideae, Hawaiian lobeliads, and the silversword alliance) for which calibrated phylogenies were available. For height and leaf size, rates were two to approximately 300 times greater in the Hawaiian silversword alliance than in the other clades considered. These results highlight the value of direct estimates of rates of trait evolution for comparative analysis of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and trait diversification.},

@article{Mouillot2007,
abstract = {The relation between functional traits and abundance of species has the potential to provide evidence on the mechanisms that structure local ecological communities. The niche-limitation/limiting-similarity hypothesis, derived from MacArthur and Levins' original concept, predicts that species that are similar to others in terms of functional traits will suffer greater competition and hence be less abundant. On the other hand, the environment-filtering/habitat-optimum hypothesis predicts that groups of species with functional traits that are close to the optimum for that environment, and are therefore similar to other species, will be more abundant. We propose a new niche-assembly model for predicting the relative abundance of species in communities from their functional traits, which can detect the patterns that would be expected from either of these hypotheses. The model was fitted to eight plant communities sampled in the Lake Ohau district of New Zealand. For seven of the sites, the patterns could not be distinguished from that expected under a null model. However, in one site there was highly significant departure from the null model in the direction expected from the niche-limitation hypothesis. The site was probably the most productive of those examined. It is possible that competition for light rather than belowground resources, or faster recovery from disturbance, allowed greater predictability. Surprisingly, the predictability was seen when just the presences of a species' neighbours in trait space were taken into account, but not when the potential effects of those neighbours were weighted by their abundance. For three of the four model types, the effects of species on each other were consistently negative: a significant trend. These results contradict the various neutral models of ecological communities.},

abstract = {Predicting climate change impact on ecosystem structure and services is one of the most important challenges in ecology. Until now, plant species response to climate change has been described at the level of fixed plant functional types, an approach limited by its inflexibility as there is much interspecific functional variation within plant functional types. Considering a plant species as a set of functional traits greatly increases our possibilities for analysis of ecosystem functioning and carbon and nutrient fluxes associated therewith. Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on plant functional traits, allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that plant functional traits can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59{\%} of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year's shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase. This finding demonstrates that plant functional traits constitute a highly useful concept for forecasting changes in plant communities, and their associated ecosystem services, in response to climate change.},

abstract = {Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about their capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional traits and their conservation. We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size. We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes. Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats. Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity.},

abstract = {We surveyed the literature published since 1985 for evidence of natural selection and heritability in vegetative functional traits and performance. Our goals were to (1) review patterns of selection on specific functional traits and (2) assess general evolutionary questions about selection and heritability for broad classes of traits. While generalizations about the functional significance of specific traits are premature, several functional hypotheses are supported. For example, herbivores can exert strong selection on secondary chemistry and mechanical defenses, but costs of resistance and negative correlations between defense traits may constrain their evolution. Competitive interactions select for early germination and favor stem elongation and shifts in flowering time where such responses actually minimize competitive effects. In the very few studies of physiology, selection on gas exchange and leaf size is clearly environment dependent. More generally, in reciprocal transplant experiments, populations often are locally adapted, and selection favors the native phenotype. These results suggest that selection is important in functional trait evolution and population differentiation. At the same time, selection often varies in space and time and across life-history episodes. This variation could slow the rate of evolutionary change, maintain genetic variation within populations, and select for plasticity. Analyses of general questions revealed that indirect selection through correlated characters accounts for a substantial portion of total selection on traits and often appears to reinforce the pattern of direct selection. This could be due to environmental effects on multiple phenotypic traits and fitness. Alternatively, indirect selection could contribute to the rapid evolution of suites of traits. We found only weak evidence that traits under strong selection have low heritability, a pattern that has been reported for animals and predicted by some theory. Thus, the rate of evolutionary change may well differ among traits. The strength of selection also depended on the fitness measure, being stronger selection through cumulative fitness than fertility or vegetative performance. Attributes of species' biology and experimental design affected selection and heritability estimates. Heritability was lower in inbreeding species relative to outbreeders, as expected. Heritabilities in controlled environments substantially overestimate estimates from the wild and should not be used as reliable predictors of the rate of adaptive evolutionary change in natural populations. Likewise, broad-sense heritability overestimates narrow-sense heritability and is thus unreliable for predicting evolutionary change in outbreeding species. Future studies of functional trait evolution should focus on physiology and a broader array of phenological and developmental traits. Long-lived species are severely underrepresented in microevolutionary studies, no doubt for practical reasons. Finally, an emphasis should be placed on exploring the nature and effect of trait interactions on fitness, since these are likely to be very important in shaping the course of evolution.},

abstract = {Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem function in a rapidly changing world is a major research challenge in ecology. Traits-based approaches have elicited much recent interest, yet individual studies are not advancing a more general, predictive ecology. Significant progress will be facilitated by adopting a coherent theoretical framework comprised of three elements: an underlying trait distribution, a performance filter defining the fitness of traits in different environments, and a dynamic projection of the performance filter along some environmental gradient. This framework allows changes in the trait distribution and associated modifications to community composition or ecosystem function to be predicted across time or space. The structure and dynamics of the performance filter specify two key criteria by which we judge appropriate quantitative methods for testing traits-based hypotheses. Bayesian multilevel models, dynamical systems models and hybrid approaches meet both these criteria and have the potential to meaningfully advance traits-based ecology.},

abstract = {A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9-55{\%} of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41{\%} of the variation in growth rate and 54{\%} of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits vary both along environmental gradients and among species occupying similar conditions, creating a challenge for the synthesis of functional and community ecology. We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

abstract = {Two main theories have attempted to explain variation in plant species composition ($\beta$-diversity). Niche theory proposes that most of the variation is related to environment (environmental filtering), whereas neutral theory posits that dispersal limitation is the main driver of $\beta$-diversity. In this study, we first explored how $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity of plant functional groups defined by growth form (trees, shrubs and lianas, which represent different strategies of resource partitioning), and dispersal syndrome (autochory, anemochory and zoochory, which represent differences in dispersal limitation) vary with successional age and topographic position in a tropical dry forest. Second, we examined the effects of environmental, spatial, and spatially-structured environmental factors on $\beta$-diversity of functional groups; we used the spatial structure of sampling sites as a proxy for dispersal limitation, and elevation, soil properties and forest stand age as indicators of environmental filtering. We recorded 200 species and 22,245 individuals in 276 plots; 120 species were trees, 41 shrubs and 39 lianas. We found that $\beta$-diversity was highest for shrubs, intermediate for lianas and lowest for trees, and was slightly higher for zoochorous than for autochorous and anemochorous species. All three dispersal syndromes, trees and shrubs varied in composition among vegetation classes (successional age and topographic position), whilst lianas did not. $\beta$-diversity was influenced mostly by proxies of environmental filtering, except for shrubs, for which the influence of dispersal limitation was more important. Stand age and topography significantly influenced $\alpha$-diversity across functional groups, but showed a low influence on $\beta$-diversity -possibly due to the counterbalancing effect of resprouting on plant distribution and composition. Our results show that considering different plant functional groups reveals important differences in both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity patterns and correlates that are not apparent when focusing on overall woody plant diversity, and that have important implications for ecological theory and biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {Plants are sessile organisms, often characterized by limited dispersal. Seeds and pollen are the critical stages for gene flow. Here we investigate spatial genetic structure, gene dispersal and the relative contribution of pollen vs seed in the movement of genes in a stable metapopulation of the white campion Silene latifolia within its native range. This short-lived perennial plant is dioecious, has gravity-dispersed seeds and moth-mediated pollination. Direct measures of pollen dispersal suggested that large populations receive more pollen than small isolated populations and that most gene flow occurs within tens of meters. However, these studies were performed in the newly colonized range (North America) where the specialist pollinator is absent. In the native range (Europe), gene dispersal could fall on a different spatial scale. We genotyped 258 individuals from large and small (15) subpopulations along a 60 km, elongated metapopulation in Europe using six highly variable microsatellite markers, two X-linked and four autosomal. We found substantial genetic differentiation among subpopulations (global F(ST)=0.11) and a general pattern of isolation by distance over the whole sampled area. Spatial autocorrelation revealed high relatedness among neighboring individuals over hundreds of meters. Estimates of gene dispersal revealed gene flow at the scale of tens of meters (5-30 m), similar to the newly colonized range. Contrary to expectations, estimates of dispersal based on X and autosomal markers showed very similar ranges, suggesting similar levels of pollen and seed dispersal. This may be explained by stochastic events of extensive seed dispersal in this area and limited pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {The tree species composition of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) in north-eastern and central Brazil is analyzed to address the following hypotheses: (1) variations in species composition are related to both environment (climate and substrate) and spatial proximity; (2) SDTF floristic units may be recognized based on peculiar composition and environment; and (3) the Arboreal Caatinga, a deciduous forest occurring along the hinterland borders of the Caatinga Domain, is one of these units and its flora is more strongly related to the caatinga vegetation than to outlying forests. The study region is framed by the Brazilian coastline, 50th meridian west and 21st parallel south, including the Caatinga Domain and extensions into the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado Domains. Multivariate and geostatistic analyses were performed on a database containing 16,226 occurrence records of 1332 tree species in 187 georeferenced SDTF areas and respective environmental variables. Tree species composition varied significantly with both environmental variables and spatial proximity. Eight SDTF floristic units were recognized in the region, including the Arboreal Caatinga. In terms of species composition, its tree flora showed a stronger link with that of the Cerrado Dry Forest Enclaves. On the other hand, in terms of species frequency across sample areas, the links were stronger with two other units: Rock Outcrops Caatinga and Agreste and Brejo Dry Forests. There is a role for niche-based control of tree species composition across the SDTFs of the region determined primarily by the availability of ground water across time and secondarily by the amount of soil mineral nutrients. Spatial proximity also contributes significantly to the floristic cohesion of SDTF units suggesting a highly dispersal-limited tree flora. These units should be given the status of eco-regions to help driving the conservation policy regarding the protection of their biodiversity.},

abstract = {Species diversity may be additively partitioned within and among samples (alpha and beta diversity) from hierarchically scaled studies to assess the proportion of the total diversity (gamma) found in different habitats, landscapes, or regions. We developed a statistical approach for testing null hypotheses that observed partitions of species richness or diversity indices differed from those expected by chance, and we illustrate these tests using data from a hierarchical study of forest-canopy beetles. Two null hypotheses were implemented using individual- and sample-based randomization tests to generate null distributions for alpha and beta components of diversity at multiple sampling scales. The two tests differed in their null distributions and power to detect statistically significant diversity components. Individual-based randomization was more powerful at all hierarchical levels and was sensitive to departures between observed and null partitions due to intraspecific aggregation of individuals. Sample-based randomization had less power but still may be useful for determining whether different habitats show a higher degree of differentiation in species diversity compared with random samples from the landscape. Null hypothesis tests provide a basis for inferences on partitions of species richness or diversity indices at multiple sampling levels, thereby increasing our understanding of how alpha and beta diversity change across spatial scales.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (Ra(2)) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, U.S.A.},

abstract = {Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

@article{Mayfield2009,
abstract = {Environmental filtering is a fundamental process in the ecological assembly of communities. Recently developed phylogenetic tools identify patterns associated with environmental filtering across whole communities. Here we introduce a novel method that allows the detection of traits involved in the environmental filtering of species from specific clades in specific habitat types. Our approach identifies nonindependent trait/habitat/clade (THC) associations and also provides a framework for detecting clearly defined two-way trait/clade, trait/habitat, and clade/habitat associations. The THC method relies on exact binomial tests and differentiates THC associations resulting from a three-way interaction from those that are generated by one or more underlying significant two-way interactions. It can also detect THC associations for which there are no significant two-way associations (trait/habitat, trait/clade, clade/habitat). To illustrate the THC method, we examine plant pollination and dispersal traits from six habitat types in a fragmented Costa Rican landscape. Results suggest that these traits are not widely important for the environmental filtering of most clades in this landscape, but animal dispersal and insect pollination are involved in the filtering of monocots and the Piperaceae in rain forest understory.},

abstract = {To investigate the existence of coordinated sets of seedling traits adapted to contrasting establishment conditions, we examined evolutionary convergence in seedling traits for 299 French Guianan woody plant species and the stress response in a shadehouse of species representing seed size gradients within five major cotyledon morphology types. The French Guianan woody plant community has larger seeds than other tropical forest communities and the largest proportion of hypogeal cotyledon type (59.2{\%}) reported for tropical forests. Yet the community includes many species with intermediate size seeds that produce seedlings with different cotyledonal morphologies. A split-plot factorial design with two light levels (0.8{\%} and 16.1{\%} PAR) and four damage treatments (control, seed damage, leaf damage, stem damage) was used in the shadehouse experiment. Although larger-seeded species had higher survival and slower growth, these patterns were better explained by cotyledon type than by seed mass. Even larger-seeded species with foliar cotyledons grew faster than species with reserve-type cotyledons, and survival after stem grazing was five times higher in seedlings with hypogeal cotyledons than with epigeal cotyledons. Thus, to predict seedling performance using seed size, seedling morphology must also be considered.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence-absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the "FD" R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

abstract = {We developed a quantitative method, analogous to those used in statistical mechanics, to predict how biodiversity will vary across environments, which plant species from a species pool will be found in which relative abundances in a given environment, and which plant traits determine community assembly. This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94{\%} of the variance in the relative abundances.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and sampled area is fundamental to ecology. Traditionally, theories of the species-area relationship have been dominated by random-placement models. Such models were used to formulate the canonical theory of species-area curves and species abundances. In this paper, however, armed with a detailed data set from a moist tropical forest, we investigate the validity of random placement and suggest improved models based upon spatial aggregation. By accounting for intraspecific, small-scale aggregation, we develop a cluster model which reproduces empirical species-area curves with high fidelity. We find that inter-specific aggregation patterns, on the other hand, do not affect the species-area curves significantly. We demonstrate that the tendency for a tree species to aggregate, as well as its average clump size, is not significantly correlated with the species' abundance. In addition, we investigate hierarchical clumping and the extent to which aggregation is driven by topography. We conclude that small-scale phenomena such as dispersal and gap recruitment determine individual tree placement more than adaptation to larger-scale topography.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

A recent and thought-provoking paper (Jurasinski et al. Oecologia 159:15-26, 2009) draws attention to the lack of precision with which the terms alpha, beta, and gamma diversity are used and proposes three new terms in their place. While this valuable effort may improve our understanding of the different facets of species diversity, it still leaves us far from achieving a consistent terminology. As such, the conceptual contribution of these authors is limited and does little to elucidate the facets of species diversity. It is, however, a good starting point for an in-depth review of the available concepts and methods.},

abstract = {A consistent terminology for species diversity is subject of an ongoing debate. Recently Tuomisto (Oecologia 164:853-860, 2010) stated that a consistent terminology for diversity already exists. The paper comments on recent papers by ourselves (Jurasinski et al. Oecologia 159:15-26, 2009) and by Moreno and Rodriguez (Oecologia 163:279-282, 2010). Both started from Whittaker's diversity concept to discuss the ambiguities of the terminology and propose a new, more consistent terminology that is based on the different approaches to diversity analysis. In contrast, Tuomisto adheres to a strict school of thinking and derives a diversity framework in the sense of Whittaker (alpha, beta, gamma) from the conceptual definition of diversity itself. A third group of papers discusses appropriate methods for the analysis of the variation in species composition. Here, we support the idea that alpha, beta and gamma diversity should be used in a strict sense that is based only on the conceptual definition of diversity. We accordingly extend and modify our terminological concept for species diversity. All approaches to the analysis and quantification of species composition and diversity can be assigned to three abstraction levels (species composition, variation in species composition,and variation in variation in species composition) and two scale levels (sample scale, aggregation scale). All methods that investigate the variation in species composition across scale levels evaluate beta relation with beta diversity being just one form of beta relation, which is calculated by dividing gamma diversity of order q by the appropriate alpha diversity of the same order. In contrast, differentiation refers to a pairwise calculation of resemblance in species composition. It is restricted to sample scale and is therefore most often only an intermediate step of analysis. Many ecological questions can be addressed either by direct analysis of the variation in species composition using raw data approaches or by further analysis of differentiation datasets on aggregation scale with or without respect to an external gradient.},

Some points have been clearly stated in previous papers of this Views and Comments section, and new terms have even been proposed for specific cases, but other issues, such as the need for the prefix true have not been discussed. Our aim is to clarify some of the terms and concepts, the proper use of which appears still to remain unclear, and to provide biologists with a simplified version of the general framework resulting from recent contributions, with an emphasis on identifying points of consensus in the field. We also comment on the possibility of extending the basics of this general framework to other facets of the broad term biodiversity, such as functional or phylogenetic diversity.},

In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

@article{Jurasinski2009,
abstract = {Almost half a century after Whittaker (Ecol Monogr 30:279-338, 1960) proposed his influential diversity concept, it is time for a critical reappraisal. Although the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity introduced by Whittaker have become general textbook knowledge, the concept suffers from several drawbacks. First, alpha and gamma diversity share the same characteristics and are differentiated only by the scale at which they are applied. However, as scale is relative--depending on the organism(s) or ecosystems investigated--this is not a meaningful ecological criterion. Alpha and gamma diversity can instead be grouped together under the term "inventory diversity." Out of the three levels proposed by Whittaker, beta diversity is the one which receives the most contradictory comments regarding its usefulness ("key concept" vs. "abstruse concept"). Obviously beta diversity means different things to different people. Apart from the large variety of methods used to investigate it, the main reason for this may be different underlying data characteristics. A literature review reveals that the multitude of measures used to assess beta diversity can be sorted into two conceptually different groups. The first group directly takes species distinction into account and compares the similarity of sites (similarity indices, slope of the distance decay relationship, length of the ordination axis, and sum of squares of a species matrix). The second group relates species richness (or other summary diversity measures) of two (or more) different scales to each other (additive and multiplicative partitioning). Due to that important distinction, we suggest that beta diversity should be split into two levels, "differentiation diversity" (first group) and "proportional diversity" (second group). Thus, we propose to use the terms "inventory diversity" for within-sample diversity, "differentiation diversity" for compositional similarity between samples, and "proportional diversity" for the comparison of inventory diversity across spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Whittaker first proposed to measure the variation in species composition among plots or beta-diversity as the ratio between regional diversity (gamma-diversity) and average local diversity (alpha-diversity). More recently, an alternative way of partitioning diversity for which beta-diversity is obtained as the difference between gamma-diversity and average alpha-diversity has become very popular for linking the structure of species assemblages to ecosystem functioning in a spatially explicit manner. Unfortunately, additive beta-diversity computed from species presences and absences suffers from the major drawback of being dependent on regional species richness. For instance, if the separation between beta-diversity and gamma-diversity is incomplete, so that variation in species composition is affected by species richness, then differences in beta-diversity values among different sets of plots could reflect differences in the species count rather than any fundamental difference in species composition among the plots. Based on the above observation, in this paper I will first propose a basic requirement for beta-diversity measures that adequately captures our intuitive notion of independence of species richness. Next, I will show that additive beta-diversity computed from species presence and absence scores can be interpreted within the framework of fuzzy set theory. Finally, based on this unusual "fuzzy" interpretation of additive beta-diversity, I will introduce two families of parametric beta-diversity measures whose members have varying sensitivities to the presence of rare and frequent species.},

abstract = {The biological literature about diversity and similarity indices is a mess. Much of it is superficial and confusing, and some of it is just plain wrong. Biologists frequently confuse diversity with other quantities, and frequently use diversity indices inappropriately. On the other hand many biologists have sensed that there is something suspicious about the way diversity indices are used, but their solution is to avoid frequency-based diversity and similarity measures altogether and use only species richness and the basic similarity measures derived from it, like the Jaccard and Sorensen indices. Yet ecologically significant differences between communities are really differences in species frequencies, not mere presence or absence. Abusing or avoiding the analysis of diversity and similarity holds back the whole field. What is diversity? What diversity index should be used for a particular purpose? How should diversity indices be interpreted? What is the real definition of alpha and beta diversity-are alpha and beta multiplicative, as in Whittaker's law (alpha times beta equals gamma), or are they additive as in Lande's (1996) definition (alpha plus beta equals gamma), or neither? What do similarity and overlap measures really measure and which ones should be used? How are they related to diversity measures, and how are diversity measures related to each other?},

abstract = {Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites ($\beta$ diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in $\beta$ diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that $\beta$ diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness ($\gamma$ diversity), these differences in $\beta$ diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of $\beta$ diversity.},

@article{Mayfield2013,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: PREMISE OF STUDY: Plant functional traits are commonly used as proxies for plant responses to environmental challenges, yet few studies have explored how functional trait distributions differ across gradients of land-use change. By comparing trait distributions in intact forests with those across land-use change gradients, we can improve our understanding of the ways land-use change alters the diversity and functioning of plant communities.

METHODS: We examined how the variation and distribution of trait values for seven plant functional traits differ between reference natural forest and three types of land-use conversion (pasture, old-field, or "legacy" sites-regrowth following logging), landscape productivity (NPP) and vegetation strata (tree or non-tree "understory"), in a meta-analysis of studies from 15 landscapes across five continents.

KEY RESULTS: Although trait variation often differed between land-uses within a landscape, these patterns were rarely consistent across landscapes. The variance and distribution of traits were more likely to differ consistently between natural forest and land-use conversion categories for understory (non-tree) plants than for trees. Landscape productivity did not significantly alter the difference in trait variance between natural forest and land-use conversion categories for any trait except dispersal.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that even for traits well linked to plant environmental response strategies, broad classes of land-use change and landscape productivity are not generally useful indicators of the mechanisms driving compositional changes in human-modified forest systems.},

The main hypotheses are that species composition is either (i) uniform over large areas, (ii) random but spatially autocorrelated because of dispersal limitation, or (iii) patchy and environmentally determined. Here we test these hypotheses, using a large data set from western Amazonia. The uniformity hypothesis gains no support, but the other hypotheses do. Environmental determinism explains a larger proportion of the variation in floristic differences between sites than does dispersal limitation; together, these processes explain 70 to 75{\%} of the variation. Consequently, it is important that management planning for conservation and resource use take into account both habitat heterogeneity and biogeographic differences.},

abstract = {Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles repeatedly forced thermal zones up and down the slopes of mountains, at all latitudes. Although no one doubts that these temperature cycles have left their signature on contemporary patterns of geography and phylogeny, the relative roles of ecology and evolution are not well understood, especially for the tropics. To explore key mechanisms and their interactions in the context of chance events, we constructed a geographical range-based, stochastic simulation model that incorporates speciation, anagenetic evolution, niche conservatism, range shifts and extinctions under late Quaternary temperature cycles along tropical elevational gradients. In the model, elevational patterns of species richness arise from the differential survival of founder lineages, consolidated by speciation and the inheritance of thermal niche characteristics. The model yields a surprisingly rich variety of realistic patterns of phylogeny and biogeography, including close matches to a variety of contemporary elevational richness profiles from an elevational transect in Costa Rica. Mountaintop extinctions during interglacials and lowland extinctions at glacial maxima favour mid-elevation lineages, especially under the constraints of niche conservatism. Asymmetry in temperature (greater duration of glacial than of interglacial episodes) and in lateral area (greater land area at low than at high elevations) have opposing effects on lowland extinctions and the elevational pattern of species richness in the model--and perhaps in nature, as well.},

abstract = {We examined variability in hierarchical beta diversity across ecosystems, geographical gradients, and organism groups using multivariate spatial mixed modeling analysis of two independent data sets. The larger data set comprised reported ratios of regional species richness (RSR) to local species richness (LSR) and the second data set consisted of RSR:LSR ratios derived from nested species-area relationships. There was a negative, albeit relatively weak, relationship between beta diversity and latitude. We found only relatively subtle differences in beta diversity among the realms, yet beta diversity was lower in marine systems than in terrestrial or freshwater realms. Beta diversity varied significantly among organisms' major characteristics such as body mass, trophic position, and dispersal type in the larger data set. Organisms that disperse via seeds had highest beta diversity, and passively dispersed organisms showed the lowest beta diversity. Furthermore, autotrophs had lower beta diversity than organisms higher up the food web; omnivores and carnivores had consistently higher beta diversity. This is evidence that beta diversity is simultaneously controlled by extrinsic factors related to geography and environment, and by intrinsic factors related to organism characteristics.},

The application of SDM in the megadiverse neotropics-where data on species occurrences are scarce-presents several challenges, involving acknowledging the limitations imposed by data quality, including surveys as an integral part of SDM studies, and designing the analyses in accordance with the question investigated. Specific solutions were discussed, and a code of good practice in SDM studies and related field surveys was drafted.},

They comprise a variety of compounds of various chemical properties (many of which being persistent in the environment), toxic potential, and mechanism of action. Safety assessment for drinking water is conducted by allocating health-based guidelines for exposure through this environmental medium. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) approach is used by WHO in the case of pesticides with assumed thresholds of effect, while low-dose extrapolation is used in the case of non-threshold carcinogens. Risk management, however, can also be based on the precautionary principle. Risk assessment evaluates the risk emanating from a given exposure on the basis of all available data.},

@article{Gabriel2006,
abstract = {Biodiversity studies that guide agricultural subsidy policy have generally compared farming systems at a single spatial scale: the field. However, diversity patterns vary across spatial scales. Here, we examined the effects of farming system (organic vs. conventional) and position in the field (edge vs. center) on plant species richness in wheat fields at three spatial scales. We quantified alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity at the microscale in 800 plots, at the mesoscale in 40 fields, and at the macroscale in three regions using the additive partitioning approach, and evaluated the relative contribution of beta-diversity at each spatial scale to total observed species richness. We found that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity were higher in organic than conventional fields and higher at the field edge than in the field center at all spatial scales. In both farming systems, beta-diversity at the meso- and macroscale explained most of the overall species richness (up to 37{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively), indicating considerable differences in community composition among fields and regions due to environmental heterogeneity. The spatial scale at which beta-diversity contributed the most to overall species richness differed between rare and common species. Total richness of rare species (present in {\textless} or = 5{\%} of total samples) was mainly explained by differences in community composition at the meso- and macroscale (up to 27{\%} and 48{\%}, respectively), but only in organic fields. Total richness of common species (present in {\textgreater} or = 25{\%} of total samples) was explained by differences in community composition at the micro- and mesoscale (up to 29{\%} and 47{\%}, respectively), i.e., among plots and fields, independent of farming system. Our results show that organic farming made the greatest contribution to total species richness at the meso (among fields) and macro (among regions) scale due to environmental heterogeneity. Hence, agri-environment schemes should exploit this large-scale contribution of beta-diversity by tailoring schemes at regional scales to maximize dissimilarity between conservation areas using geographic information systems rather than focusing entirely at the classical local-field scale, which is the current practice.},

@article{Sugihara2003,
abstract = {We examine a hypothesized relationship between two descriptions of community structure: the niche-overlap dendrogram that describes the ecological similarities of species and the pattern of relative abundances. Specifically, we examine the way in which this relationship follows from the niche hierarchy model, whose fundamental assumption is a direct connection between abundances and underlying hierarchical community organization. We test three important, although correlated, predictions of the niche hierarchy model and show that they are upheld in a set of 11 communities (encompassing fishes, amphibians, lizards, and birds) where both abundances and dendrograms were reported. First, species that are highly nested in the dendrogram are on average less abundant than species from branches less subdivided. Second, and more significantly, more equitable community abundances are associated with more evenly branched dendrogram structures, whereas less equitable abundances are associated with less even dendrograms. This relationship shows that abundance patterns can give insight into less visible aspects of community organization. Third, one can recover the distribution of proportional abundances seen in assemblages containing two species by treating each branch point in the dendrogram as a two-species case. This reconstruction cannot be achieved if abundances and the dendrogram are unrelated and suggests a method for hierarchically decomposing systems. To our knowledge, this is the first test of a species abundance model based on nontrivial predictions as to the origins and causes of abundance patterns, and not simply on the goodness-of-fit of distributions.},

abstract = {Ecologists often face the task of studying the association between single species and one or several groups of sites representing habitat types, community types, or other categories. Besides characterizing the ecological preference of the species, the strength of the association usually presents a lot of interest for conservation biology, landscape mapping and management, and natural reserve design, among other applications. The indices most frequently employed to assess these relationships are the phi coefficient of association and the indicator value index (IndVal). We compare these two approaches by putting them into a broader framework of related measures, which includes several new indices. We present permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of species-site group associations and bootstrap methods for obtaining confidence intervals. Correlation measures, such as the phi coefficient, are more context-dependent than indicator values but allow focusing on the preference of the species. In contrast, the two components of an indicator value index directly assess the value of the species as a bioindicator because they can be interpreted as its positive predictive value and sensitivity. Ecologists should select the most appropriate index of association strength according to their objective and then compute confidence intervals to determine the precision of the estimate.},

abstract = {Diversity partitioning has become a popular method for analyzing patterns of alpha and beta diversity. A recent evaluation of the method emphasized a distinction between additive and multiplicative partitioning and further advocated the use of multiplicative partitioning based on a presumed independence between alpha and beta. Concurrently, additive partitioning was criticized for producing dependent alpha and beta estimates. Until now, the issue of statistical independence of alpha and beta (in either type of partitioning) has not been thoroughly examined, partly due to confusion about the meaning of statistical independence. Here, we adopted a probability-based definition of statistical independence that is essentially identical to the definition found in any statistics textbook. We used a data simulation approach to show that alpha and beta diversity are not statistically independent in either additive or multiplicative partitioning. However, the extent of the dependence is not so great that it cannot be overcome by using appropriate statistical techniques to control it. Both additive and multiplicative partitioning are statistically valid and logically sound approaches to analyzing diversity patterns.},

abstract = {Ecological variables often fluctuate synchronously over wide geographical areas, a phenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation or spatial synchrony. Development of statistical approaches designed to test for spatial autocorrelation combined with the increasing accessibility of long-term, large-scale ecological datasets are now making it possible to document the patterns and understand the causes of spatial synchrony at scales that were previously intractable. These developments promise to foster significant future advances in understanding population regulation, metapopulation dynamics and other areas of population ecology.},

Exciting new developments in scaling up from individual level movement to descriptions of this movement at the macroscopic level highlighted the importance of mechanistic approaches, with different descriptions at the microscopic level leading to different ecological outcomes. At higher levels of organization, different macroscopic descriptions of movement also led to different properties at the ecosystem and larger scales. New developments from Levy flight descriptions to the incorporation of new methods from physics and elsewhere are revitalizing research in spatial ecology, which will both increase understanding of fundamental ecological processes and lead to tools for better management.},

@article{Anderson2006c,
abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~{n}}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

abstract = {Species abundance distributions (SADs) follow one of ecology's oldest and most universal laws--every community shows a hollow curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare species and just a few common species. Here, we review theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science.},

@article{Chao2012,
abstract = {There have been intense debates about the decomposition of regional diversity (gamma) into its within-community component (alpha) and between-community component (beta). Although a recent Ecology Forum achieved consensus in the use of "numbers equivalents" (Hill numbers) as the proper choice of diversity measure, three related major issues were still left unresolved. (1) What is the precise meaning of the "independence" or "statistical independence" of alpha diversity and beta diversity? (2) Which partitioning (additive vs. multiplicative) should be used for a given application? (3) What is the proper formula for alpha diversity, as there are two formulas in the literature? This paper proposes a possible resolution to each of these issues. For the first issue, we clarify the definitions of "independence" and "statistical independence" from two perspectives so that confusion about this issue can be cleared up. We also discuss the causes of dependence, so that the dependence relationship between any two diversity components in both partitioning schemes can be rigorously justified by theory and also intuitively understood by simulation. For the second issue, both multiplicative and additive beta diversities based on Hill numbers are useful measures and quantify different aspects of communities. However, neither can be directly applied to compare relative compositional similarity or differentiation across multiple regions with different numbers of communities because multiplicative beta diversity depends on the number of communities, and additive beta diversity additionally depends on alpha (equivalently, on gamma). Such dependences should be removed. We propose transformations to remove these dependences, and we show that the transformed multiplicative beta and additive beta both lead to the same classes of measures, which are always in a range of [0, 1] and thus can be used to compare relative similarity or differentiation among communities across multiple regions. These similarity measures include multiple-community generalizations of the S{\o}renson, Jaccard, Horn, and Morisita-Horn measures. For the third issue, we present some observations including a finding about which alpha formula produces independent alpha and beta components. These may help to resolve the choice of a proper formula for alpha diversity. Some related issues are also briefly discussed.},

@article{Dewar2008,
abstract = {Recently there has been growing interest in the use of maximum relative entropy (MaxREnt) as a tool for statistical inference in ecology. In contrast, here we propose MaxREnt as a tool for applying statistical mechanics to ecology. We use MaxREnt to explain and predict species abundance patterns in ecological communities in terms of the most probable behaviour under given environmental constraints, in the same way that statistical mechanics explains and predicts the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. We show that MaxREnt unifies a number of different ecological patterns: (i) at relatively local scales a unimodal biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in good agreement with published data on grassland communities, (ii) the predicted relative frequency of rare vs. abundant species is very similar to the empirical lognormal distribution, (iii) both neutral and non-neutral species abundance patterns are explained, (iv) on larger scales a monotonic biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in agreement with the species-energy law, (v) energetic equivalence and power law self-thinning behaviour are predicted in resource-rich communities. We identify mathematical similarities between these ecological patterns and the behaviour of thermodynamic systems, and conclude that the explanation of ecological patterns is not unique to ecology but rather reflects the generic statistical behaviour of complex systems with many degrees of freedom under very general types of environmental constraints.},

@article{Gosselin2006,
abstract = {Evenness is the component of species diversity that was built to be mathematically independent from species richness. Yet, earlier work questioned the generality of this independence. However, this earlier work involved only a few relative abundance distributions (RADs), very limited gradients of species richness, or evenness indices, such as Pielou's index, that were not defined in relation to a precise, coherent set of axioms. We show that for very different theoretical RADs, a relationship between evenness indices and species richness does exist and is strong-at least for some RADs and/or when species richness is under 20. Furthermore, this relationship is mostly negative, which contradicts some previous studies. We also show that, for the very uneven RADs we tested, evenness indices depend even more on species richness than diversity indices do. Finally, we discuss the philosophy behind the analysis of evenness-richness relationships within and between RADs, as well as the interest of correcting evenness indices for species richness when species richness varies, especially with many values under 20.},

abstract = {The application of information theory (IT) to ecology has occurred along two separate lines: (1) it has been used to quantify the distribution of stocks and numbers of organisms; and (2) it has been employed to quantify the pattern of interactions of trophic processes. By and large, the first endeavor has resulted in relatively few insights into ecosystem dynamics and has generated much ambiguity and disappointment, so that most ecologists remain highly skeptical about the advisability of applying IT to ecology. By contrast, the second, and less well-known application has shed light on the possibility that ecosystem behavior is the most palpable example of a purely natural 'infodynamics' that transcends classical dynamics, but remains well within the realm of quantitative description.},

@article{Sagar2008,
abstract = {The study focuses on understorey-overstorey plant community dynamics in a dry tropical forest to facilitate appropriate management decisions. We compare community composition and species diversity of the understorey vegetation among five dry tropical forest sites in northern India. A total of 1500 quadrats distributed over 15 one-ha permanent plots in five sites differing in the degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate the understorey tree species and the results were compared with overstorey tree layer. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination revealed that human disturbance intensity, as well as the overall disturbance regimes, and soil water holding capacity controlled the organisation of dry tropical forest understorey composition through effects on soil organic matter. The alpha-diversity and its components decreased with increasing human disturbance intensity, reflecting utilisation pressure and decreased soil fertility, as also revealed by the analysis of overstorey tree layer. There was a significant positive relationship between overstorey and understorey diversity. Results suggest that in the future, the existing understorey tree communities may replace the current dry tropical forest communities under prevailing environmental conditions. The study also asserts that the rate of species accumulation will be greater in more disturbed sites as well as at small spatial scale within each disturbance level.},

abstract = {We use Hubbell's neutral theory to predict the impact of habitat fragmentation on Amazonian tree communities. For forest fragments isolated for about two decades, we generate neutral predictions for local species extinction, changes in species composition within fragments, and increases in the probability that any two trees within a fragment are conspecific. We tested these predictions using fragment and intact forest data from the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonia. To simulate complete demographic isolation, we excluded immigrants--species absent from a fragment or intact forest plot in the initial census but present in its last census--from our tests. The neutral theory correctly predicted the rate of species extinction from different plots as a function of the diversity and mortality rate of trees in each plot. However, the rate of change in species composition was much faster than predicted in fragments, indicating that different tree species respond differently to environmental changes. This violates the key assumption of neutral theory. When immigrants were included in our calculations, they increased the disparity between predicted and observed changes in fragments. Overall, neutral theory accurately predicted the pace of local extinctions in fragments but consistently underestimated changes in species composition.},

@article{Diaz2007,
abstract = {Global environmental change affects the sustained provision of a wide set of ecosystem services. Although the delivery of ecosystem services is strongly affected by abiotic drivers and direct land use effects, it is also modulated by the functional diversity of biological communities (the value, range, and relative abundance of functional traits in a given ecosystem). The focus of this article is on integrating the different possible mechanisms by which functional diversity affects ecosystem properties that are directly relevant to ecosystem services. We propose a systematic way for progressing in understanding how land cover change affects these ecosystem properties through functional diversity modifications. Models on links between ecosystem properties and the local mean, range, and distribution of plant trait values are numerous, but they have been scattered in the literature, with varying degrees of empirical support and varying functional diversity components analyzed. Here we articulate these different components in a single conceptual and methodological framework that allows testing them in combination. We illustrate our approach with examples from the literature and apply the proposed framework to a grassland system in the central French Alps in which functional diversity, by responding to land use change, alters the provision of ecosystem services important to local stakeholders. We claim that our framework contributes to opening a new area of research at the interface of land change science and fundamental ecology.},

abstract = {A seedling's chances of establishing successfully are likely to be affected by the quantity of metabolic reserves in the seed. Seed size is thought to evolve as a compromise between producing numerous smaller seeds, each with few resources, and fewer larger seeds, each with more resources. Seed size varies 10(11)-fold across plant species, so the compromise has been struck at very different levels. These basic ideas have been accepted for 50 years, and many studies have interpreted seed size differences between species by reference to larger seed size being adaptive under a variety of hazards. However, experimental tests of the benefits of large seed size in relation to particular hazards have been rare. More experiments are now being reported, but a consistent picture has yet to emerge. There is typically at least a 10(5)-fold range of seed mass between species even within a single area, suggesting that much seed size variation is evolutionarily associated with other plant attributes.},

@article{Whittaker1965,
abstract = {Most plant communities consist of several or many species which compete for light, water, and nutrients. Species in a given community may be ranked by their relative success in competition; productivity seems to be the best measure of their success or importance in the community. Curves of decreasing productivity connect the few most important species (the dominants) with a larger number of species of intermediate importance (whose number primarily determines the community's diversity or richness in species) and a smaller number of rare species. These curves are of varied forms and are believed to express different patterns of competition and niche differentiation in communities. It is probably true of plants, as of animals, that no two species in a stable community occupy the same niche. Evolution of niche differentiation makes possible the occurrence together of many plant species which are partial, rather than direct, competitors. Species tend to evolve also toward habitat differentiation, toward scattering of their centers of maximum population density in relation to environmental gradients, so that few species are competing with one another in their population centers. Evolution of both niche and habitat differentiation permits many species to exist together in communities as partial competitors, with distributions broadly and continuously overlapping, forming the landscape's many intergrading communities.},

abstract = {The potential consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning and services at local scales have received considerable attention during the last decade, but little is known about how biodiversity affects ecosystem processes and stability at larger spatial scales. We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

Support is claimed when models lacking species differences predict highly aggregated metrics, such as species abundance distributions (SADs) or species area distributions (SARs). Here, I summarize why UNTB generates confusion, and is not actually relevant to niche theory (i.e. an explanation for why and how many species coexist). Equal probability is not a theory, but lack of one; it does not include or exclude any process relevant to coexistence of competitors. Models lacking explicit species can make useful predictions, but this does not support neutral theory. I provide s suggestions that could help reduce confusion generated by the debate.},

Using neutral ecological theory, we show that the relative species-abundance distributions in fynbos can be explained by migration rates that are two orders of magnitude lower than they are in tropical rain forests. Speciation rates, which are indexed by the "biodiversity parameter" Theta, are estimated to be higher than they are in any previously examined plant system.},

abstract = {Neutral and niche theories give contrasting explanations for the maintenance of tropical tree species diversity. Both have some empirical support, but methods to disentangle their effects have not yet been developed. We applied a statistical measure of spatial structure to data from 14 large tropical forest plots to test a prediction of niche theory that is incompatible with neutral theory: that species in heterogeneous environments should separate out in space according to their niche preferences. We chose plots across a range of topographic heterogeneity, and tested whether pairwise spatial associations among species were more variable in more heterogeneous sites. We found strong support for this prediction, based on a strong positive relationship between variance in the spatial structure of species pairs and topographic heterogeneity across sites. We interpret this pattern as evidence of pervasive niche differentiation, which increases in importance with increasing environmental heterogeneity.},

@article{Buckley2008,
abstract = {Patterns of species turnover are central to the geography of biodiversity and resulting challenges for conservation, but at broad scales remain relatively little understood. Here, we take a first spatially-explicitly and global perspective to link the spatial turnover of species and environments. We compare how major groups of vertebrate ectotherms (amphibians) and endotherms (birds) respond to spatial environmental gradients. We find that high levels of species turnover occur regardless of environmental turnover rates, but environmental turnover provides a lower bound for species turnover. This lower bound increases more steeply with environmental turnover in tropical realms. While bird and amphibian turnover rates are correlated, the rate of amphibian turnover is four times steeper than bird rates. This is the same factor by which average geographic ranges of birds are larger than those of amphibians. Narrow-ranged birds exhibit rapid rates of species turnover similar to those for amphibians, while wide-ranged birds largely drive the aggregate patterns of avian turnover. We confirm a strong influence of the environment on species turnover that is mediated by range sizes and regional history. In contrast to geographic patterns of species richness, we find that the turnover in one group (amphibians) is a much better predictor for the turnover in another (birds) than is environment. This result confirms the role of amphibian sensitivity to environmental conditions for patterns of turnover and supports their value as a surrogate group. This spatially-explicit analysis of environmental turnover provides understanding for conservation planning in changing environments.},

The constructed graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure. Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, and random series do so into random graphs. Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks, enhancing the fact that power law degree distributions are related to fractality, something highly discussed recently. Some remarkable examples and analytical tools are outlined to test the method's reliability. Many different measures, recently developed in the complex network theory, could by means of this new approach characterize time series from a new point of view.},

@article{Loreau1998,
abstract = {Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

@article{Phillips2004,
abstract = {Previous work has shown that tree turnover, tree biomass and large liana densities have increased in mature tropical forest plots in the late twentieth century. These results point to a concerted shift in forest ecological processes that may already be having significant impacts on terrestrial carbon stocks, fluxes and biodiversity. However, the findings have proved controversial, partly because a rather limited number of permanent plots have been monitored for rather short periods. The aim of this paper is to characterize regional-scale patterns of 'tree turnover' (the rate with which trees die and recruit into a population) by using improved datasets now available for Amazonia that span the past 25 years. Specifically, we assess whether concerted changes in turnover are occurring, and if so whether they are general throughout the Amazon or restricted to one region or environmental zone. In addition, we ask whether they are driven by changes in recruitment, mortality or both. We find that: (i) trees 10 cm or more in diameter recruit and die twice as fast on the richer soils of southern and western Amazonia than on the poorer soils of eastern and central Amazonia; (ii) turnover rates have increased throughout Amazonia over the past two decades; (iii) mortality and recruitment rates have both increased significantly in every region and environmental zone, with the exception of mortality in eastern Amazonia; (iv) recruitment rates have consistently exceeded mortality rates; (v) absolute increases in recruitment and mortality rates are greatest in western Amazonian sites; and (vi) mortality appears to be lagging recruitment at regional scales. These spatial patterns and temporal trends are not caused by obvious artefacts in the data or the analyses. The trends cannot be directly driven by a mortality driver (such as increased drought or fragmentation-related death) because the biomass in these forests has simultaneously increased. Our findings therefore indicate that long-acting and widespread environmental changes are stimulating the growth and productivity of Amazon forests.},

abstract = {Beta diversity can be measured in different ways. Among these, the total variance of the community data table Y can be used as an estimate of beta diversity. We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and anova. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and among-group components by manova, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

abstract = {Growing interest in spatial ecology is promoting new approaches to the study of seed dispersal, one of the key processes determining the spatial structure of plant populations. Seed-dispersion patterns vary among plant species, populations and individuals, at different distances from parents, different microsites and different times. Recent field studies have made progress in elucidating the mechanisms behind these patterns and the implications of these patterns for recruitment success. Together with the development and refinement of mathematical models, this promises a deeper, more mechanistic understanding of dispersal processes and their consequences.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

abstract = {The current range of ecological habitats occupied by a species reflects a combination of the ecological tolerance of the species, dispersal limitation, and competition. Whether the current distribution of a species accurately reflects its niche has important consequences for the role of ecological niche modeling in predicting changes in species ranges as the result of biological invasions and climate change. We employed a detailed data set of species occurrence and spatial variation in biotic and abiotic attributes to model the niche of a native California annual plant, Collinsia sparsiflora. We tested the robustness of our model for both the realized and fundamental niche by planting seeds collected from four populations, representing two ecotypes, into plots that fully represented the five-dimensional niche space described by our model. The model successfully predicted which habitats allowed for C. sparsiflora persistence, but only for one of the two source ecotypes. Our results show that substantial niche divergence has occurred in our sample of four study populations, illustrating the importance of adequately sampling and describing within-species variation in niche modeling.},

abstract = {Understanding and mitigating the impact of an ever-increasing population and global economic activity on tropical forests is one of the great challenges currently facing biologists, conservationists and policy makers. Tropical forests currently face obvious regional changes, both negative and positive, and uncertain global changes. Although deforestation rates have increased to unprecedented levels, natural secondary succession has reclaimed approximately 15{\%} of the area deforested during the 1990s. Governments have also protected 18{\%} of the remaining tropical moist forest; however, unsustainable hunting continues to threaten many keystone mammal and bird species. The structure and dynamics of old-growth forests appear to be rapidly changing, suggesting that there is a pantropical response to global anthropogenic forcing, although the evidence comes almost exclusively from censuses of tree plots and is controversial. Here, I address ongoing anthropogenic change in tropical forests and suggest how these forests might respond to increasing anthropogenic pressure.},

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

If these models are reliable, they should relate to change in plant growth and function. In this paper, we ask the question whether habitat suitability models are able to predict variation in plant functional traits, often assumed to be a good surrogate for a species' overall health and vigour. Using a thorough sampling design, we show a tight link between variation in plant functional traits and habitat suitability for some species, but not for others. Our contrasting results pave the way towards a better understanding of how species cope with varying habitat conditions and demonstrate that habitat suitability models can provide meaningful descriptions of the functional niche in some cases, but not in others.},

abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

abstract = {Explaining the mechanisms that produce the enormous diversity within and between tropical tree communities is a pressing challenge for plant community ecologists. Mechanistic hypotheses range from niche-based deterministic to dispersal-based stochastic models. Strong tests of these hypotheses require detailed information regarding the functional strategies of species. A few tropical studies to date have examined trait dispersion within individual forest plots using species trait means in order to ask whether coexisting species tend to be more or less functionally similar than expected given a null model. The present work takes an alternative approach by: (i) explicitly incorporating population-level trait variability; and (ii) quantifying the functional beta diversity in a series of 15 tropical forest plots arrayed along an elevational gradient. The results show a strong pattern of decay in community functional similarity with elevation. These observed patterns of functional beta diversity are shown to be highly non-random and support a deterministic model of tropical tree community assembly and turnover.},

abstract = {Patterns of biodiversity are ultimately the product of speciation and extinction. Speciation serves as the biodiversity pump while extinction serves as the agent that culls global to local levels of biodiversity. Linking these central processes to global and local patterns of biodiversity is a key challenge in both ecology and evolution. This challenge necessarily requires a simultaneous consideration of the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity across space and the tree of life. In this review, I outline a research framework for biodiversity science that considers the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate and cull levels of biodiversity and that influence the inter-relationships between species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. I argue that a biodiversity synthesis must begin with a consideration of the inherently ecological process of speciation and end with how global biodiversity is filtered into local-scale plant communities. The review ends with a brief outlook on future challenges for those studying biodiversity, including outstanding hypotheses that need testing and key data limitations.},

abstract = {Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.},

They are contentious because they have been wrongly ascribed to some animal species through use of incorrect statistical methods and because they have not been adequately compared against strong alternative models, such as composite correlated random walks. This lack of comparison has been partly because the strong alternative models do not have simple likelihood functions. Here I show that power-spectra and the distribution of the first significant digits (the leading non-zero digits) of the step lengths can distinguish between L{\'{e}}vy walks and composite correlated random walks. Using these diagnostic tools, I bolster previous claims that honey bees use a movement strategy that can be approximated by L{\'{e}}vy walks when searching for their hive or for a food source.},

abstract = {A current focus of ecology is the investigation of spatial effects on population and community dynamics; however, spatiotemporal theory remains largely untested by empirical observations or experimental studies. For example, the segregation hypothesis predicts that intraspecific aggregation should increase the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition, thereby enhancing local coexistence in plant communities. We applied recent methods of point pattern analysis to analyze a unique long-term data set on fully mapped seedling emergence and subsequent survival in a Mediterranean gorse shrubland after experimental fires and simulated torrential rainfall events. Our overall aim was to test if the observed spatial patterns were consistent with the segregation hypothesis during the entire community dynamics from early seedling emergence to the establishment of a mature community, i.e., we explored if the observed initial segregation did indeed prevent interspecific competition from becoming dominant. We used random labeling as the null model and specific test statistics to evaluate different biological effects of the spatial interactions that determine mortality. We found that mortality was clearly not random. Comparison of the probability of mortality in dependence on the distance to conspecific and to heterospecific plants showed that mortality was controlled almost entirely by intraspecific interactions, which is consistent with the segregation hypothesis. Dead plants were aggregated and segregated from surviving plants, indicating two-sided scramble competition. Spatial interactions were density dependent and changed their sign over the course of time from positive to negative when plants grew to maturity. The simulated torrential rainfall events and subsequent erosion caused nonspecific mortality of seedlings but did not reduce the prevalence of intraspecific competition. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of plants may profoundly affect competition and can be an important determinant in the coexistence of species and biodiversity.},

abstract = {A fundamental challenge in ecology is to understand the mechanisms that govern patterns of relative species abundance. Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.},

@article{Peres-Neto2006b,
abstract = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I. error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

abstract = {The paper responds to the question: How should one go about designing the statistical analysis of biodiversity if it had to be done across scales in time and space? The conceptual basis of the design is the definition of biodiversity as a convolution of two community components. One of the components is richness, the product of species evolution, and the other structure, the consequence of environmental sorting (biotic, physical). The method of choice takes information in the manner of frequency distributions, and decomposes the associated total diversity into additive components specific to the deemed sorting factors. Diversity quantities are supplied by the analysis by which the relative importance of sorting factors can be measured and the dynamic oscillations which they generate in diversity can be traced. Examples support the a priori idea that the velocity of compositional change in the community during the late quaternary period has co-varied closely with the specific components of Kolmogorov-type complexity, Anand's structural complexity and R{\'{e}}nyi's entropy of order one. The paper explains what is involved and why is it important.},

abstract = {How and why organisms are distributed as they are has long intrigued evolutionary biologists. The tendency for species to retain their ancestral ecology has been demonstrated in distributions on local and regional scales, but the extent of ecological conservatism over tens of millions of years and across continents has not been assessed. Here we show that biome stasis at speciation has outweighed biome shifts by a ratio of more than 25:1, by inferring ancestral biomes for an ecologically diverse sample of more than 11,000 plant species from around the Southern Hemisphere. Stasis was also prevalent in transocean colonizations. Availability of a suitable biome could have substantially influenced which lineages establish on more than one landmass, in addition to the influence of the rarity of the dispersal events themselves. Conversely, the taxonomic composition of biomes has probably been strongly influenced by the rarity of species' transitions between biomes. This study has implications for the future because if clades have inherently limited capacity to shift biomes, then their evolutionary potential could be strongly compromised by biome contraction as climate changes.},

One way is to identify 'biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a 'silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.},

abstract = {The observation that a few species in ecological communities are exceptionally abundant, whereas most are rare, prompted the development of species abundance models. Nevertheless, despite the large literature on the commonness and rarity of species inspired by these pioneering studies, some widespread empirical patterns of species abundance resist easy explanation. Notable among these is the observation that in large assemblages there are more rare species than the log normal model predicts. Here we use a long-term (21-year) data set, from an estuarine fish community, to show how an ecological community can be separated into two components. Core species, which are persistent, abundant and biologically associated with estuarine habitats, are log normally distributed. Occasional species occur infrequently in the record, are typically low in abundance and have different habitat requirements; they follow a log series distribution. These distributions are overlaid, producing the negative skew that characterizes real data sets.},

abstract = {A model is developed to relate community structure to level of environmental disturbance in systems in which the effects of disturbance are localized in space and time. In general these disturbances create a pattern of spatio-temporal heterogeneity by renewing a limiting resource, thereby permitting utilization by species that are not dominant competitors. The proposed model predicts the frequency distribution of these renewed areas, with regard to size and age (colonization stage). The model thus allows one to relate overall system pattern to the local biology within these areas, to compare various areas with different levels of disturbance, and to predict the effects of new disturbance.},

abstract = {The neutral theory for community structure and biodiversity is dependent on the assumption that species are equivalent to each other in all important ecological respects. We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Hubbell's 2001 neutral theory unifies biodiversity and biogeography by modelling steady-state distributions of species richness and abundances across spatio-temporal scales. Accurate predictions have issued from its core premise that all species have identical vital rates. Yet no ecologist believes that species are identical in reality. Here I explain this paradox in terms of the ecological equivalence that species must achieve at their coexistence equilibrium, defined by zero net fitness for all regardless of intrinsic differences between them. I show that the distinction of realised from intrinsic vital rates is crucial to evaluating community resilience.},

@article{Jones2008,
abstract = {The degree to which variation in plant community composition (beta-diversity) is predictable from environmental variation, relative to other spatial processes, is of considerable current interest. We addressed this question in Costa Rican rain forest pteridophytes (1,045 plots, 127 species). We also tested the effect of data quality on the results, which has largely been overlooked in earlier studies. To do so, we compared two alternative spatial models [polynomial vs. principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM)] and ten alternative environmental models (all available environmental variables vs. four subsets, and including their polynomials vs. not). Of the environmental data types, soil chemistry contributed most to explaining pteridophyte community variation, followed in decreasing order of contribution by topography, soil type and forest structure. Environmentally explained variation increased moderately when polynomials of the environmental variables were included. Spatially explained variation increased substantially when the multi-scale PCNM spatial model was used instead of the traditional, broad-scale polynomial spatial model. The best model combination (PCNM spatial model and full environmental model including polynomials) explained 32{\%} of pteridophyte community variation, after correcting for the number of sampling sites and explanatory variables. Overall evidence for environmental control of beta-diversity was strong, and the main floristic gradients detected were correlated with environmental variation at all scales encompassed by the study (c. 100-2,000 m). Depending on model choice, however, total explained variation differed more than fourfold, and the apparent relative importance of space and environment could be reversed. Therefore, we advocate a broader recognition of the impacts that data quality has on analysis results. A general understanding of the relative contributions of spatial and environmental processes to species distributions and beta-diversity requires that methodological artefacts are separated from real ecological differences.},

@article{Beaudrot2011,
abstract = {1. A major goal in community ecology is to identify mechanisms that govern the assembly and maintenance of ecological communities. Current models of metacommunity dynamics differ chiefly in the relative emphasis placed on dispersal limitation and niche differentiation as causal mechanisms structuring ecological communities. Herein we investigate the relative roles of these two mechanisms in structuring primate communities in Africa, South America, Madagascar and Borneo. 2. We hypothesized that if dispersal limitation is important in structuring communities, then community similarity should depend on geographical proximity even after controlling for ecological similarity. Conversely, if communities are assembled primarily through niche processes, then community similarity should be determined by ecological similarity regardless of geographical proximity. 3. We performed Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate correlations among primate community similarity, ecological distance and geographical distance. Results showed significant and strongly negative relationships between diurnal primate community similarity and both ecological similarity and geographical distance in Madagascar, but significant and stronger negative relationships between community similarity and geographical distance in African, South American and Bornean metacommunities. 4. We conclude that dispersal limitation is an important determinant of primate community structure and may play a stronger role in shaping the structure of some terrestrial vertebrate communities than niche differentiation. These patterns are consistent with neutral theory. We recommend tests of functional equivalence to determine the extent to which neutral theory may explain primate community composition.},

abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species.},

abstract = {Patterns of tree abundance and dispersion in a tropical deciduous (dry) forest are summarized. The generalization that tropical trees have spaced adults did not hold. All species were either clumped or randomly dispersed, with rare species more clumped than common species. Breeding system was unrelated to species abundance or dispersion, but clumping was related to mode of seed dispersal. Juvenile densities decreased approximately exponentially away from adults. Rare species gave evidence of poor reproductive performance compared with their performance when common in nearby forests. Patterns of relative species abundance in the dry forest are compared with patterns in other forests, and are explained by a simple stochastic model based on random-walk immigration and extinction set in motion by periodic community disturbance.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal organization of ecological processes and features and the scales at which they occur are central topics to landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics, and increasingly regarded as a cornerstone paradigm for understanding ecological processes. Hence, there is need for computational approaches which allow the identification of the proper spatial or temporal scales of ecological processes and the explicit integration of that information in models. For that purpose, we propose a new method (multiscale codependence analysis, MCA) to test the statistical significance of the correlations between two variables at particular spatial or temporal scales. Validation of the method (using Monte Carlo simulations) included the study of type I error rate, under five statistical significance thresholds, and of type II error rate and statistical power. The method was found to be valid, in terms of type I error rate, and to have sufficient statistical power to be useful in practice. MCA has assumptions that are met in a wide range of circumstances. When applied to model the river habitat of juvenile Atlantic salmon, MCA revealed that variables describing substrate composition of the river bed were the most influential predictors of parr abundance at 0.4-4.1 km scales whereas mean channel depth was more influential at 200-300 m scales. When properly assessed, the spatial structuring observed in nature may be used purposefully to refine our understanding of natural processes and enhance model representativeness.},

abstract = {Recently, analytical approaches based on the eigenfunctions of spatial configuration matrices have been proposed in order to consider explicitly spatial predictors. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distance-based (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.},

@article{Gilbert2004,
abstract = {A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand what controls the distribution and abundance of species. Both environmental niches and trade-offs among species in dispersal and competitive ability have traditionally been cited as determinants of plant community composition. More recently, neutral models have shown that communities of species with identical life-history characteristics and no adaptation to environmental niches can form spatial distribution patterns similar to those found in nature, so long as the species have a limited dispersal distance. If there is a strong correlation between geographic distance and change in environmental conditions, however, such spatial patterns can arise through either neutral or niche-based processes. To test these competing theories, we developed a sampling design that decoupled distance and environment in the understory plant communities of an old-growth, temperate forest. We found strong evidence of niche-structuring but almost no support for neutral predictions. Dispersal limitation acted in conjunction with environmental gradients to determine species' distributions, and both functional and phylogenetic constraints appear to contribute to the niche differentiation that structures community assembly. Our results indicate that testing a neutral hypothesis without accounting for environmental gradients will at best cause unexplained variation in plant distributions and may well provide misleading support for neutrality because of a correlation between geographic distance and environment.},

abstract = {Understanding how communities of living organisms assemble has been a central question in ecology since the early days of the discipline. Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co-occur randomly but are restricted in their co-occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co-occurrence of species is a product of chance, historical patterns of speciation and migration, dispersal, abiotic environmental factors, and biotic interactions, with none of these processes being mutually exclusive. Here we present a survey and meta-analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with null models simulating random patterns of species assembly. According to the type of data under study and the different methods that are applied to detect community assembly, we distinguish four main types of approach in the published literature: species co-occurrence, niche limitation, guild proportionality and limiting similarity. Results from our meta-analyses suggest that non-random co-occurrence of plant species is not a widespread phenomenon. However, whether this finding reflects the individualistic nature of plant communities or is caused by methodological shortcomings associated with the studies considered cannot be discerned from the available metadata. We advocate that more thorough surveys be conducted using a set of standardized methods to test for the existence of assembly rules in data sets spanning larger biological and geographical scales than have been considered until now. We underpin this general advice with guidelines that should be considered in future assembly rules research. This will enable us to draw more accurate and general conclusions about the non-random aspect of assembly in plant communities.},

abstract = {The current spatial pattern of a population is the result of previous individual birth, death, and dispersal events. We present a simple model followed by a comparative analysis for a species-rich plant community to show how the current spatial aggregation of a population may hold information about recent population dynamics. Previous research has shown how locally restricted seed dispersal often leads to stronger aggregation in less abundant populations than it does in more abundant populations. In contrast, little is known about how changes in the local abundance of a species may affect the spatial distribution of individuals. If the level of aggregation within a species depends to some extent on the abundance of the species, then changes in abundance should lead to subsequent changes in aggregation. However, an overall change of spatial pattern relies on many individual birth and death events, and a surplus of deaths or births may have short-term effects on aggregation that are opposite to the long-term change predicted by the change in abundance. The change in aggregation may therefore lag behind the change in abundance, and consequently, the current aggregation may hold information about recent population dynamics. Using an individual-based simulation model with local dispersal and density-dependent competition, we show that, on average, recently growing populations should be more aggregated than shrinking populations of the same current local abundance. We tested this hypothesis using spatial data on individuals from a long-term tropical rain forest plot, and find support for this relationship in canopy trees, but not in understory and shrub species. On this basis we argue that current spatial aggregation is an important characteristic that contains information on recent changes in local abundance, and may be applied to taxonomic groups where dispersal is limited and within-species aggregation is observed.},

In a community with a naturally discontinuous spatial structure, we asked (1) at what scale(s) nonrandom variation in species composition occurs and (2) at what scale(s) such variation is associated with spatial separation, indicative of dispersal limitation, and at what scale(s) variation is associated with environmental heterogeneity? We sampled 50 seeps (small wetlands) on five serpentine outcrops. Using a randomization model, we showed that additive beta diversity (a measure of community dissimilarity) was lower than random within seeps and higher than random among both seeps and outcrops. Using Mantel tests, we showed that plant community dissimilarity, in both the full seep assemblage as well as in a subset of seep endemics, at the two larger scales was associated with different forms of environmental heterogeneity and, at the largest scale, was also associated with geographic distance. We conclude that diversity in this system is shaped by multiple scales of heterogeneity and by dispersal limitation at the largest scale.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

@article{Chave2002a,
abstract = {Abstract: Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

@article{Chase2003a,
abstract = {Community assembly provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the processes that determine which and how many species live in a particular locality. Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},
annote = {The processes that determine the patterns of the number and composition of co-occurring species have been central to community ecology for decades (Gleason 1927; Clements 1938; Samuels and Drake 1997; Belyea and Lancaster 1999; Weiher and Keddy 1999). In 1975, Jared Diamond proposed that community composition was characterized by a series of ‘Assembly Rules', which could be predicted by a few key variables, such as the size of the species pool, the abiotic environment, and inter- specific interactions.},

@article{Blanchet2011,
abstract = {During the last 20 years, ecologists discovered the importance of including spatial relationships in models of species distributions. Among the latest developments in modelling how species are spatially structured are eigenfunction-based spatial filtering methods such as Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). Although these methods are very powerful and flexible, they are only suited to study distributions resulting from non-directional spatial processes. The asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) framework, a new eigenfunction-based spatial filtering method, fills this theoretical gap. AEM was specifically designed to model spatial structures hypothesized to be produced by directional spatial processes. Water currents, prevailing wind on mountainsides, river networks, and glaciations at historical time scales are some of the situations where AEM can be used. This paper presents three applications of the method illustrating different combinations of: sampling schemes (regular and irregular), data types (univariate and multivariate), and spatial scales (metres, kilometres, and hundreds of kilometres). The applications include the distribution of a crustacean (Atya) in a river, bacterial production in a lake, and the distribution of the copepodite stages of a crustacean on the Atlantic oceanic shelf. In each application, a comparison is made between AEM, MEM, and PCNM. No environmental components were included in the comparisons. AEM was a strong predictor in all cases, explaining 59.8{\%} for Atya distribution, 51.4{\%} of the bacterial production variation, and 38.4{\%} for the copepodite distributions. AEM outperformed MEM and PCNM in these applications, offering a powerful and more appropriate tool for spatial modelling of species distributions under directional forcing and leading to a better understanding of the processes at work in these systems.},

abstract = {The central themes of community ecology-distribution, abundance, and diversity-display strongly marked and very general patterns. These include the log-normal distribution of abundance, the relation between range and abundance, the species-area law, and the turnover of species composition. Each pattern is the subject of a large literature that interprets it in terms of ecological processes, typically involving the sorting of differently specialized species onto heterogeneous landscapes. All of these patterns can be shown to arise, however, from neutral community models in which all individuals have identical properties, as the consequence of local dispersal alone. This implies, at the least, that functional interpretations of these patterns must be reevaluated. More fundamentally, neutral community models provide a general theory for biodiversity and conservation biology capable of predicting the fundamental processes and patterns of community ecology.},

Here, we provide a roadmap of the most widely used and ecologically relevant approaches for analysis through a series of mission statements. We distinguish two types of $\beta$ diversity: directional turnover along a gradient vs. non-directional variation. Different measures emphasize different properties of ecological data. Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in $\beta$ diversity for a given dataset. A case study of Indonesian coral assemblages shows the utility of a multi-faceted approach. We advocate careful consideration of relevant questions, matched by appropriate analyses. The rigorous application of null models will also help to reveal potential processes driving observed patterns in $\beta$ diversity.},

We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly.},

abstract = {Dispersal among ecological communities is usually assumed to be random in direction, or to vary in distance or frequency among species. However, a variety of natural systems and types of organisms may experience dispersal that is biased by directional currents or by gravity on hillslopes. We developed a general model for competing species in metacommunities to evaluate the role of directionally biased dispersal on species diversity, abundance, and traits. In parallel, we tested the role of directionally biased dispersal on communities in a microcosm experiment with protists and rotifers. Both the model and experiment independently demonstrated that diversity in local communities was reduced by directionally biased dispersal, especially dispersal that was biased away from disturbed patches. Abundance of species (and composition) in local communities was a product of disturbance intensity but not dispersal directionality. High disturbance selected for species with high intrinsic growth rates and low competitive abilities. Overall, our conclusions about the key role of dispersal directionality in (meta)communities seem robust and general, since they were supported both by the model, which was set in a general framework and not parameterized to fit to a specific system, and by a specific experimental test with microcosms.},

abstract = {This article explores the combined evolutionary and ecological responses of resource uptake abilities in a generalist consumer to exploitative competition for one resource using a simple 2-resource model. It compares the sizes of ecologically and evolutionarily caused changes in population densities in cases where the original consumer has a strong or a weak trade-off in its abilities to consume the two resources. The analysis also compares the responses of the original species to competition when the competitor's population size is or is not limited by the shared resource. Although divergence in resource use traits in the resident generalist consumer is expected under all scenarios when resources are substitutable, the changes in population densities of the resources and resident consumer frequently differ between scenarios. The population of the original consumer often decreases as a result of its own adaptive divergence, and this decrease is often much greater than the initial ecological decrease. If the evolving consumer has a strong trade-off, the overlapped resource increases in equilibrium population density in response to being consumed by a generalist competitor. Some of these predictions differ qualitatively in alternative scenarios involving sustained variation in population densities or nutritionally essential resources.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological community can provide insights into the relative importance of different processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP, and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from 10 x 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities, the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats. In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats, but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has several possible explanations, including variation in the strength of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will need to include information on species traits in order to explain the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical forests.},
