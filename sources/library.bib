abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Running title: Abundancebased multiplesite dissimilarity Summary 1. Abundancebased assemblage dissimilarity can be partitioned into components accounting for (i) balanced variation in abundance, whereby the individuals of some species in one site are substituted by the same number of individuals of different species in another site, and (ii) abundance gradients, whereby some individuals are lost from one site to the other. 2. Such a method was available for pairwise dissimilarity but not for multiplesite dissimilarity. 3. New multiplesite extensions of BrayCurtis and Ruzicka indices based on the formulation of multiplesite analogues of matching components (i.e. the intersection and the relative complements among multiple sites in terms of species abundances) are introduced. 4. These new indices can be partitioned into balancedvariation and abundancegradients components. 5. An example assessing multiplesite dissimilarity of birds and butterflies in a mosaic of habitats is shown to illustrate the usefulness of comparing incidenceand abundancebased multiplesite dissimilarity and its components to characterize biotic heterogeneity across multiple sites. 6. The method may be generally useful when the question of interest is the overall abundancebased dissimilarity across multiple units (in space, time or other), as separating the balancevariation (i.e. substitution) and abundancegradients (i.e. subsets) components of dissimilarity can shed light on the processes behind variation in species abundances.},
